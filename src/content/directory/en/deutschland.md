Germany is among the most important countries in the international flight simulation scene. With Aerosoft as one of the world's largest publishers, the Flightsim.to community platform and a dense landscape of forums, virtual airlines and content creators, the country has assumed a central role in the virtual aviation ecosystem.

The German flight simulation community benefits from a strong aviation tradition and complex airspace that is attractive to both virtual pilots and aspiring air traffic controllers. Both VATSIM and IVAO maintain active German divisions with structured training programs and regular events.

The picture is complemented by numerous German-language forums and news portals that have accompanied the scene for over two decades. From the beginnings with FS98 to modern Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, the German community has actively shaped every generational transition.

The annual FS Conference in Paderborn and the Flight Simulator Area at AERO Friedrichshafen additionally offer opportunities for personal exchange between developers, manufacturers and enthusiasts.
