Spain holds a prominent place in the global flight simulation landscape. With a deep-rooted aeronautical tradition, complex airspace and an active community of virtual pilots and controllers, the Spanish simulation ecosystem is one of the most dynamic in Europe.

The Spanish presence is supported by two fundamental pillars: the national divisions of VATSIM and IVAO. VATSIM Spain has over 900 active members and handles nearly 19,000 monthly flights, while IVAO España exceeds 2,500 users and organizes regular events that attract participants from across Europe. Both networks offer comprehensive training programs for pilots and controllers.

The landscape is completed by a robust offering of virtual airlines covering Spain's major carriers, from Iberia and Air Europa to Vueling, as well as professional simulation centers in Madrid and Barcelona, scenery developers and a growing community of Spanish-language content creators.

## Online Networks

**VATSIM Spain** is the Spanish division of VATSIM, with over 900 active members and an average of 19,000 monthly flights. The division operates a virtual pilot school (EVA) with personalized courses and certification, plus a comprehensive controller training program based on EuroScope. Spanish Thursdays regularly bring together pilots and controllers with full ATC coverage of Spanish airspace.

**IVAO España** is one of IVAO's largest divisions worldwide, with over 2,500 active users and more than one million combined hours online. The CAVOK training program offers structured training for pilots and controllers, with practice aerodromes at major Spanish airports. The division organizes national tours, themed events and regular group flights.

## Virtual Airlines

**AirHispania**, founded in 2000, is the reference virtual airline and simulation school in the Spanish-speaking world. Its training program spans from PPL VFR to ATPL, plus comprehensive air traffic control courses. It operates multiple flight divisions and organizes international tours.

**Iberia Virtual** simulates Iberia, Iberia Express and Air Nostrum operations with routes updated from real database. It has a fleet of over 320 aircraft, including historical models from the 80s and 90s, and uses the vAMSYS Pegasus system for flight management.

**Air Europa Virtual** replicates Air Europa operations with hundreds of domestic and international routes, while **Anyway Virtual Airlines**, with over 17 years of experience, operates as an IVAO-certified airline with group flights and participation in international events.

**LAE - Línea Aérea Española**, founded in 2024 and certified by IVAO and VATSIM, offers over 15,000 routes with a flight management system compatible with both networks and offline mode. **airvalencia**, a Valencian virtual airline founded in 2020, has over 50 active pilots, 300 routes and its own flight school.

**Vueling Virtual**, integrated into the Virtual European Airline Group (vEAG), simulates Vueling Airlines' short and medium-haul operations across Europe with schedules based on real data and the vAMSYS platform.

## Communities and Forums

**X-Plane.es** is the main Spanish-speaking forum dedicated to the X-Plane simulator, with over 2,000 registered members. The forum includes sections dedicated to add-ons, WED scenery creation, simulation hardware and online flying, with activity recorded in February 2026.

## Add-on Developers

**SpainUHD** is a Spanish free ultra-high resolution photoscenery project covering the entire Spanish territory — peninsula and islands — for X-Plane. Developed by Albert Ràfols and José Ángel Estévez, the project integrates LIDAR elevation data, SIOSE-based vegetation information and PNOA orthophotography, offering an unprecedented visual representation of the country.

## Training

Spain has several professional simulation centers accessible to the public. **Aviation Group**, located in Madrid, has Airbus A320 and F-18 simulators, and offers flight experiences for enthusiasts and professional training for pilots.

In Barcelona, **BCN Sim Center** has operated for over a decade with Boeing 737-800, Beechcraft 1900D and helicopter simulators. **HANGAR 10**, at Sabadell airport, specializes in assessment training and professional training with latest-generation simulators.

**Aeroteca**, an aviation shop and simulation center in Barcelona active since 1986, offers through its Simuteca section flight simulation courses from beginner level to advanced Boeing 737 procedures.

## Media and Content Creators

**AirMoySim Simulación Aérea** is a Spanish YouTube channel dedicated to Microsoft Flight Simulator. It publishes weekly MSFS news in Spanish, hardware reviews, live flights and collaborations with other virtual pilots.

**Tripulación de Cabina** recreates historical aviation accidents and incidents using flight simulators, offering educational content on aviation safety in Spanish.

## Shops

**Opencockpits** is a Spanish manufacturer and online store specializing in professional Boeing 737-800/MAX and Airbus A320 flight simulators. It offers complete simulators ready for EASA FNPT II MCC certification, as well as individual components and custom projects for home cockpit builders.

**Vuela desde casa** is a Spanish online store dedicated to home flight simulation hardware, with cabins, stands, pedals and peripherals from brands like Next Level Racing and Thrustmaster. **BuckerBook**, an online aviation shop, has a simulation hardware section with joysticks, yokes, pedals and cabins from the main industry brands.
