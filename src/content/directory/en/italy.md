## Introduction

Italy boasts one of Europe's most vibrant and well-organized flight simulation communities, with roots stretching back over three decades. Piloti Virtuali Italiani (PVI), founded in the mid-1990s, is among the oldest flight sim associations in the world, and its longevity reflects the deep passion Italian enthusiasts bring to virtual aviation. The community operates almost entirely in Italian, making it a rich and self-contained ecosystem within the broader European scene.

The country's real-world aviation heritage — from historic airports in Rome, Milan, and Naples to the dramatic terrain of the Alps, the Dolomites, and the Mediterranean coastline — translates into exceptional flying environments for virtual pilots. Italian airspace, with its complex approach procedures and busy corridors, offers a rewarding challenge for both VFR and IFR flying.

Italy is also notable for its thriving DCS World military simulation community. Multiple organized squadrons conduct structured training and large-scale operations, reflecting a strong interest in combat aviation that sets Italy apart from many other European countries. On the civilian side, the virtual airline scene is remarkably diverse, with at least six active Italian VAs offering everything from career-based flying to firefighting and SAR missions.

The country punches above its weight in flight sim hardware manufacturing. Italian companies like CPflight and Flight Simulator Center produce professional-grade cockpit components used by enthusiasts and training centers worldwide. Italy also hosts Europe's largest public flight simulation center, Dastyflysim, near Bergamo.

## ATC Networks

VATITA is the official Italian vACC within the VATSIM network, providing virtual ATC coverage across all Italian Flight Information Regions. The division is highly active, running regular events including Real Operations sessions, Regional Rush evenings, and themed nights that bring together controllers and pilots from across Italy and Europe. Their comprehensive training program ensures consistent quality in ATC services.

IVAO Italy offers an alternative network experience with extensive documentation on Italian airspace procedures and ATC positions. The division provides structured training programs and maintains an active community of both pilots and controllers, with detailed resources specific to Italian FIR operations.

## Virtual Airlines

Italy's virtual airline scene is remarkably rich and diverse. Italiani Volanti, founded in 2010, has grown into one of the country's largest VAs, featuring a career system, Discord community, flight school, and custom liveries. Notably, the community organizes regular real-world meetups across Italy, strengthening bonds between members beyond the simulator.

Napulevola, founded in Naples in 1999, is one of Italy's oldest virtual airlines and a partner of both IVAO and VATSIM. It offers pilot career management, training sessions with industry experts, and custom scenery packages. ItalAir Virtual, founded by two real pilots, takes a unique approach by operating three brands including Alitalia Team Virtual, with an extensive fleet database and free IFR training sessions.

FlyITA distinguishes itself with high entry standards — requiring 60+ VATSIM hours and an admission exam — and custom Pilot Hub software with ACARS tracking and career progression. As an official VATITA partner, it maintains close ties to the Italian ATC community.

Virtual Over Italy offers a unique three-division structure: standard IFR/VFR flying, firefighting and SAR operations, and DCS military missions, with courses taught by real pilots and instructors. Air Sicilia Virtual Airways brings a regional flavor, operating from hubs at Palermo and Catania with a free flight school and comprehensive career system.

## Communities and Forums

Piloti Virtuali Italiani (PVI) is the cornerstone of the Italian flight sim community, celebrating over 30 years of continuous activity. As Italy's oldest and largest flight simulation association, PVI offers a virtual airline, community forums, events, and a wealth of resources for pilots of all experience levels.

Volovirtuale.com is the country's most active dedicated flight sim forum, with over 4,000 threads and 49,000 posts from 1,800+ registered users. Daily discussions cover MSFS, X-Plane, DCS, hardware, and everything in between. MSFS Italia focuses specifically on Microsoft Flight Simulator, curating the best free Italian scenery, liveries, mods, and utilities.

Mediterranea Virtual operates as both a virtual airline and a community hub, with an active forum, flight school, awards system, and regular group events spanning multiple simulators.

The DCS World community in Italy deserves special attention. Joint Air Task Force (JATF) is the largest Italian DCS community with over 400 members organized across multiple squadrons, conducting large-scale operations and international events. 36 Stormo Virtuale, founded in 2012, is organized into four flight groups — fighters, bombers, multirole, and helicopters — and produces detailed operational manuals for its members.

## Add-on Developers

Barelli MSFS Addon is the most prolific Italian scenery developer for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Their extensive catalog covers many Italian airports including Catania, Malpensa, Venezia, Torino, Trieste, Roma Ciampino, Salerno, and more, with both freeware and payware releases bringing Italian airports to life in remarkable detail.

## Media and Content Creators

FlightSimITA is the leading Italian MSFS content creator on YouTube, with over 8,400 subscribers. The channel produces tutorials, hardware reviews, and regular live streams, and its creator also founded the FlyITA virtual airline. As a Winwing ambassador, FlightSimITA serves as a bridge between the hardware and community sides of the hobby.

DCS ITALIA is the go-to YouTube channel for Italian DCS World enthusiasts, producing news analysis, cinematic trailers, and dynamic campaign content, with additional Twitch streaming sessions.

Loreair AIRCAFE is an Italian flight simulation podcast covering MSFS, DCS World, and X-Plane with reviews, opinions, and community discussions. As a Navigraph Ambassador, the host is also active on YouTube, Twitch, and Discord, creating a multi-platform presence in the Italian flight sim media landscape.

## Training

Dastyflysim, located near Bergamo and Milan, is Europe's largest public flight simulation center. Spanning 1,000 square meters, it offers a unique Boeing 737 full-motion simulator — one of the few publicly accessible in Europe — along with static B737, A320, helicopter, and fighter jet experiences. The center also provides professional pilot training courses including MCC and CRM certification.

Simulation Project in Milan offers Boeing 737-800 NG flight simulator sessions with professional instructor guidance, as well as fear-of-flying courses designed to help anxious passengers overcome their apprehension through hands-on cockpit experience.

## Shops

CPflight is a world-renowned Italian manufacturer of professional flight simulation hardware with over 20 years of experience. Based in Italy, they produce cockpit components, panels, and complete systems for Boeing 737 NG, 737 MAX, and Airbus A320 simulators, used by enthusiasts and training centers worldwide.

Direct Fly Italia, based in Pavia, is the first Italian showroom dedicated to flight simulation peripherals. As the Italian hub for Moza flight hardware, they offer joysticks, force feedback bases, and throttles, with the added advantage of a test room where customers can try products before purchasing.

Flight Simulator Center (FSC) in Padua designs, manufactures, and sells professional flight simulator components — from individual panels to complete B737, A320, and general aviation cockpit systems — serving both home cockpit builders and training facilities.

## Events

Fly&Fun International Aviation Expo is Italy's largest aviation event, held annually at San Damiano military airport in Piacenza. The expo features aircraft displays, drones, accessories, model airplanes, and a growing flight simulation component, attracting aviation enthusiasts from across Italy and beyond. The 2026 edition has been confirmed.
