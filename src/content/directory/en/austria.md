## Introduction

Austria boasts a dedicated flight simulation community that benefits from the country's unique location in the heart of Europe. From challenging Alpine airfields in Tyrol like Innsbruck (LOWI) to Vienna-Schwechat International Airport (LOWW) and the scenic runways in Carinthia and Salzburg, Austria offers a diverse virtual flying experience.

Both major virtual ATC networks are represented in Austria. VACC Austria is the Austrian division of VATSIM, providing realistic air traffic control in Austrian airspace. IVAO Austria complements the offering with its own training programs and events.

Austrian Virtual is the country's leading virtual airline, simulating Austrian Airlines operations with realistic routes and procedures. As a registered association, it operates with permission from Austrian Airlines AG and uses the vAMSYS platform for flight operations.

The German-speaking region also benefits from add-on developers like FlightSim Studio AG, whose team consists of real pilots and develops Austrian airfields for MSFS and X-Plane. Microsoft Flight Simulator has depicted Austria in even greater detail with World Update XVIII, including high-resolution terrain models and a handcrafted Salzburg Airport.

## ATC Networks

VACC Austria is the Austrian Virtual Area Control Centre of the VATSIM network, embedded within the VATSIM Europe Division (VATEUD). The division provides virtual air traffic control services throughout Austrian airspace and offers training programs for aspiring controllers. VACC Austria organises regular events and maintains an active community of aviation enthusiasts.

IVAO Austria is the Austrian division of the International Virtual Aviation Organisation. The division offers structured training programs for pilots and air traffic controllers, including examinations, tours, and special operations through the Special Operations Department. IVAO Austria welcomes both beginners and experienced virtual pilots to start their career in virtual aviation.

## Virtual Airlines

Austrian Virtual is a virtual airline simulating Austrian Airlines operations. Operated as a registered association in Austria (Austrian Virtual Airlines - Verein zum Betrieb virtueller Fluglinien), it operates with permission from Austrian Airlines AG. Since 2009, Austrian Virtual has supported various flight simulator platforms, including MSFS, X-Plane, and Prepar3D. In 2020, the airline switched to the vAMSYS platform for virtual flight operations with realistic routes and a structured system.

## Add-on Developers

FlightSim Studio AG is a developer studio specialising in highly detailed aircraft and scenery add-ons for Microsoft Flight Simulator and X-Plane. The team consists of a large number of real pilots, and projects are only undertaken when access to genuine references is available. Products include Kufstein-Langkampfen Airfield (LOIK) in Tyrol as well as various aircraft models such as the Tecnam P2012 Traveller and the Embraer E-Jets Series.

## Training

ProFlight at Vienna Aviation Campus offers full-flight simulators in close proximity to Vienna-Schwechat Airport. The training center, opened in 2006 and operated by Lufthansa Aviation Training in cooperation with Austrian Airlines, provides realistic cockpit experiences on professional flight simulators. The facility allows aviation enthusiasts to experience the life of an airline pilot in an authentic environment.
