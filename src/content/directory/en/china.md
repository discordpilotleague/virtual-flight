## Introduction

China is home to one of the largest and most active flight simulation communities in Asia. Major forums such as 中国模拟飞行网 (SinoFSX, 200,000+ registered users) and 飞行者联盟 (ChinaFlier, 128,000+ members) form a vast, self-contained ecosystem that complements the English-speaking flight sim world. Chinese flight simulation enthusiasts primarily gather on domestic platforms such as Bilibili, QQ groups, and Baidu Tieba rather than YouTube and Discord.

China's expansive airspace -- from the busy hub airports of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen to western plateau airports and high-altitude approaches -- provides virtual pilots with a unique and challenging flying environment. Domestic routes span from tropical Sanya to frigid Harbin, with terrain ranging from the Tibetan Plateau to the Yangtze River Delta and the South China coast.

In the add-on development space, Chinese development teams hold a significant position in the international market. WF Scenery Studio and SamScene3D are recognized as top-tier scenery developers, selling their Chinese airport and cityscape products through international platforms such as simMarket, Orbx, and flightsim.to to a worldwide audience.

On the hardware side, MOZA Racing (Shenzhen) is rapidly emerging as an internationally competitive force feedback flight simulation hardware brand, while CNFSimulator and WeFly carve out niches in professional simulators and DCS military cockpit panels respectively. China also maintains a unique official flight simulation competition system: the National University Flight Simulation Championship, co-hosted by the Civil Aviation Administration of China and the General Administration of Sport, has successfully run for nine editions.

## ATC Networks

VATPRC is the VATSIM mainland China division, established on July 1, 2010, covering all Chinese FIRs. The division regularly organizes online events including real-world operations days, regional ATC activities, and themed nights. VATPRC runs an official Discourse forum at community.vatprc.net, providing a discussion space for pilots and controllers.

The Chinese flight simulation community also features several independent online flight platforms. VFACSim was founded in Zhengzhou in 2020 and supports X-Plane, MSFS, and P3D multiplayer with its own ATC system and training center. SOC serves as a virtual airline operations infrastructure platform, hosting over 100 virtual airlines and providing FSClient software and a flight quality assessment system.

## Virtual Airlines

虚拟中国国际航空 is China's most prominent virtual airline, serving as an official VATSIM VAA partner since 2019 and simulating Air China operations. This VA uses the vAMSYS/Phoenix operations center and the Pegasus real-time tracking system, employing a community-driven management model.

虚拟杭州航空 was founded in March 2020 and is a founding member of the Virtual Tianqin Alliance, with over 1,000 registered pilots. The alliance operates 7 subsidiaries, with operations extending to the United States and Japan. 中国虚拟航空 (HKRS) offers a FOQA-based flight quality monitoring platform that evaluates flight quality through a detailed SOP scoring system.

The 中国模拟飞行网 forum also hosts sub-forums for multiple virtual airlines, including virtual China Southern Airlines, virtual Hainan Airlines, virtual Xiamen Airlines, and virtual Spring Airlines, reflecting the rich diversity of China's virtual airline ecosystem.

## Communities and Forums

中国模拟飞行网 (SinoFSX) is China's largest flight simulation community, founded in 2009 with over 200,000 registered users. The forum covers MSFS 2020, FSX/P3D, flight training (SFSA Academy), ATC operations, and add-on development, serving as the central hub of China's flight simulation ecosystem.

飞行者联盟 (ChinaFlier) is the second-largest Chinese flight simulation community with 128,000+ registered members. The forum covers all major simulators including MSFS, P3D, X-Plane, DCS World, and FlightGear, and features a dedicated cockpit building lab section and hardware/VR discussion boards. Its official store, 飞行者商城 (shop.chinaflier.com), sells flight simulation software and hardware.

AIRCN模拟飞行网 is another long-established Chinese flight simulation forum with its own ATC department and flight training academy (AIRCN Azure Academy), along with an add-on center containing extensive resources. 模拟飞行中心 (FSCenter) has 27,000+ members and provides online flight guides, ATC maps, and event calendars. 飞行宝 (fsx.org.cn) serves as a resource sharing platform focused on add-on downloads and tutorials for P3D, MSFS, and X-Plane.

## Add-on Developers

WF Scenery Studio is China's leading airport scenery development team. Since its founding in 2016, it has produced numerous high-quality Chinese airport sceneries including Shanghai Pudong, Beijing Capital, Shenzhen Bao'an, Nanjing Lukou, Kunming Changshui, and Hangzhou Xiaoshan. Its products sell through international platforms such as simMarket, Orbx, and flightsim.to, earning recognition as a top-tier scenery developer worldwide.

SamScene3D, also founded in 2016, specializes in detailed Chinese cityscape scenery development. Its MSFS and P3D products cover major Chinese cities including Shenzhen, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Chongqing, and the studio enjoys a strong reputation in the international cityscape scenery market. Zhouke Scenery Studio focuses on domestic airport sceneries, with products including Kashgar, Huanghua, and Changsha city scenery.

## Media and Content Creators

Unlike the English-speaking world where YouTube dominates, Chinese flight simulation content creators are primarily active on Bilibili. Diablohu is one of China's best-known flight simulation content creators, active on both Bilibili and YouTube. He produces high-quality MSFS news coverage, tutorials, hardware reviews, and landing challenges, and also runs a professional personal website at fly-dbh.com.

BC-Rail_SimTV is a popular flight simulation creator on Bilibili who frequently posts MSFS and X-Plane videos and live streams. 飞行砖家王机长 combines real aviation footage with flight simulation content, striking a good balance between educational and entertaining material.

## Shops

MOZA Racing (Shenzhen) is a rapidly rising Chinese flight simulation hardware brand. Its product line includes force feedback yoke bases (AB6/AB9), joysticks, throttle quadrants, and rudder pedals. Products are sold through the official website, Tmall, and JD.com, with offline experience stores in multiple cities nationwide. MOZA has become a strong competitor in the international market.

飞行者商城 is the official store of the 飞行者联盟 community, selling flight simulation software, livery add-ons, and hardware peripherals. CNFSimulator, based in Shanghai, manufactures A320 cockpit components and Cessna/Diamond series simulator hardware with worldwide shipping. WeFly specializes in high-fidelity DCS World military cockpit panels, manufacturing JF-17, F/A-18C, and F-16C MFD modules.

## Training

哈尔滨莱特兄弟科技, founded in 2014, is China's leading flight simulator manufacturer. The company develops CAAC/FAA/EASA-certified Level 5 FTD simulators covering B737, A320, C172, and DA40/DA42 aircraft types. It operates over 100 aviation experience centers nationwide, holds a CCAR-141 certified flight school, and has delivered 53+ professional training devices to clients including Spring Airlines.

雏鹰未来航空, based in Sichuan, was authorized by the General Administration of Sport of China as the country's first intermediate-level flight simulation training center. The company offers youth aviation courses, simulator training, and competition preparation programs, serving over 200 schools.

## Events

The 全国高校模拟飞行锦标赛 (National University Flight Simulation Championship), co-hosted by the Civil Aviation Administration of China and the General Administration of Sport, is China's most influential competitive flight simulation event. The 9th edition in 2025 attracted nearly 300 contestants from 17 universities across military and civil aviation categories, serving as an important platform to showcase young Chinese aviation talent.

The 中国国际航空航天博览会 (Zhuhai Airshow) is China's only State Council-approved international aerospace exhibition, held biennially in Zhuhai since 1996. The show features flight simulation equipment exhibits, and the 15th edition (2024) attracted 890+ exhibitors from 47 countries, making it China's largest aerospace event.
