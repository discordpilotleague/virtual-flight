## Introduction

Indonesia has one of the most active flight simulation communities in Southeast Asia. As the world's largest archipelago with over 17,000 islands and more than 200 airports, Indonesia offers a unique and challenging virtual flying experience — from busy approaches into Soekarno-Hatta and Ngurah Rai to remote airstrips in Papua and Kalimantan that demand bush flying skills.

Indonesia vACC, the Virtual Area Control Centre for Indonesian airspace on the VATSIM network, serves as the backbone of organized online flying in Indonesia. Working alongside various virtual airlines and scenery developers, the vACC provides ATC services for Jakarta FIR and Ujung Pandang FIR. IVAO Indonesia Division complements this ecosystem with regular tours, a Division Online Day every Saturday, and structured training programs.

The Indonesian scenery development community is highly active, with several teams working to bring airports across the archipelago into MSFS and X-Plane. BinerSim leads the way with its Soekarno-Hatta scenery available on the official MSFS Marketplace, while Project MAX, BDO Aviation, Suroboyo Simulation, and XPIC Team collectively cover dozens of airports throughout Indonesia.

The DCS World community also maintains a strong presence through Garuda Virtual Air Wing (GVAW), which hosts daily training sessions and weekly missions. On the content side, Nosta Bengs stands as Indonesia's largest flight simulation YouTube creator with over 147,000 subscribers.

## ATC Networks

Indonesia vACC (IDvACC) is the official Virtual Area Control Centre for Indonesian airspace on the VATSIM network, operating as part of VATSIM Southeast Asia. The division provides ATC services across all Indonesian airspace including Jakarta FIR and Ujung Pandang FIR. IDvACC regularly hosts events including cross-regional flights and themed sessions, and maintains active partnerships with Garuda Virtual and local scenery developers.

IVAO Indonesia Division offers an alternative network experience with structured pilot and ATC training programs. The division hosts a Division Online Day every Saturday from 12 to 16 UTC, regular tours such as the IDVFR Island Hopper and Borneo Celebes Expedition, and examination programs for pilot and controller certification.

## Virtual Airlines

Garuda Virtual is Indonesia's leading virtual airline on VATSIM, simulating Garuda Indonesia operations. Active since 2015, the airline offers flight assignments, tours such as Tour de Java, fleet management, and a rank progression system. Garuda Virtual integrates closely with IDvACC, creating a cohesive Indonesian virtual aviation ecosystem.

NVirtual (Nusantara Virtual Airline) simulates Indonesia-based airline operations on desktop flight simulation platforms, featuring the CrewLink system for pilot management and flight tracking.

## Communities and Forums

Indo Aviation Simmers (IAS) is the largest virtual aviation community in Indonesia, focusing on MSFS, X-Plane, and Prepar3D. The community organizes a range of activities including group flights, ATC nights, IFR/VFR procedure training workshops, and sharing sessions.

DCS Indonesia — Garuda Virtual Air Wing (GVAW), active since 2015, is the primary DCS World community in Indonesia. Established as a pioneering virtual air wing in 2020, GVAW hosts daily training, weekly missions, dynamic campaigns, and sharing sessions.
