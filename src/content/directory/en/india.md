## Introduction

India's flight simulation community has grown rapidly in recent years, fueled by the country's booming aviation industry and a tech-savvy population. With over 150 operational airports and one of the world's fastest-growing domestic aviation markets, Indian airspace offers unique challenges and rewards for virtual pilots — from the congested approaches into Mumbai and Delhi to scenic mountain airports in the Himalayas and Northeast India.

The community operates almost entirely in English, reflecting India's multilingual tech landscape. India vACC, the VATSIM Virtual Area Control Center for Indian airspace, serves as the backbone of organized online flying in the country, partnering with multiple virtual airlines and scenery developers. IVAO India Division provides an alternative network experience with its own training programs and resources.

India's virtual airline scene is anchored by IndiGo Virtual, mirroring the country's largest real-world carrier, and complemented by multiple Air India-branded VAs reflecting the national carrier's legacy. The add-on development community is notably active, with several Indian developers creating detailed scenery for airports across the subcontinent — filling a gap that has long been underserved by international developers.

The country also stands out for its professional flight simulation training infrastructure. India hosts some of Asia's largest DGCA and EASA-certified simulator training facilities, while IFS India has emerged as a domestic manufacturer of home cockpit hardware, reducing dependence on imported equipment.

## ATC Networks

India vACC is the Virtual Area Control Center for Indian airspace on the VATSIM network, part of the West Asia Division. The vACC provides ATC services covering all Indian Flight Information Regions with regular events including Kolkata Overload, cross-regional flights, and themed sessions. India vACC maintains active partnerships with IndiGo Virtual, Air India Group Virtual, Air India Virtual, and SkyMatrix Studios, creating a tightly integrated ecosystem.

IVAO India Division offers a complementary network experience with pilot and ATC training programs, flight tracking via WebEye, scenery resources, aeronautical charts, and a Discord community. The division provides structured training for both new and experienced virtual controllers.

## Virtual Airlines

IndiGo Virtual is the largest virtual airline in India, faithfully mirroring real-world IndiGo operations across a 3,900+ route network. Pilots fly the Airbus A320 family and ATR aircraft with regular VATSIM events and a structured ranking system from Cadet to Fleet Captain. The VA maintains a close partnership with India vACC.

Air India Group Virtual represents Air India and Air India Express operations with a wide-body and narrow-body fleet spanning a global route network. The VA features regular VATSIM events and a detailed pilot career progression system.

Air India Virtual, the oldest Indian virtual airline operating since 2009, has logged over 46,000 flights and 139,000 hours. Dedicated to the legacy of J.R.D. Tata — the father of Indian civil aviation — it supports MSFS, P3D, FSX, and X-Plane.

## Communities and Forums

FlightSim India is a Discord community that serves as the central hub for Indian flight simmers, connecting scenery developers, virtual pilots, and content creators. The community has played an active role in shaping freeware Indian airport scenery development.

The r/indianflightsim subreddit on Reddit provides a dedicated space for flight simulation discussions focused on Indian aviation, covering MSFS, X-Plane, P3D, DCS, and other platforms.

Virtual Indian Air Force (VIAF) is a DCS World military simulation community focused on operating aircraft using real-world Indian Air Force tactics. With nine active squadrons and structured training sessions twice a week, VIAF serves the growing Indian combat flight sim community.

## Add-on Developers

India's scenery development community has grown significantly, with multiple developers working to bring the subcontinent's airports to life in MSFS and X-Plane.

SkyMatrix Studios (formerly DesignIndia) is the most prominent Indian scenery developer, creating high-quality payware airport add-ons for MSFS including Jaipur (VIJP) and Bagdogra (VEBD) International Airports. As an official India vACC partner, their products are available on iniBuilds, Orbx, simMarket, and Contrail.

On the freeware side, rcavinash123 is the most prolific individual developer, with highly-rated MSFS and X-Plane sceneries for major Indian airports including Delhi (VIDP), Chennai (VOMM), and Hyderabad (VOHS). VForce covers smaller Indian airports with an impressive portfolio including Visakhapatnam, Srinagar, Chandigarh, Bhubaneswar, Imphal, and Dibrugarh.

MSK Productions, active since 2010, is known for their payware Mumbai International Airport (VABB) for MSFS, available on simMarket, Orbx, and iniBuilds. Alkee Creations contributes to the ecosystem with sceneries including Mumbai (freeware) and Patna (payware).

## Media and Content Creators

TheGamersToys, run by Deepak Nagmoti from Pune, is India's largest flight simulation YouTube channel with over 202,000 subscribers. Active for more than eight years, the channel features MSFS, DCS, and X-Plane live streams on VATSIM, often with real pilots as guests, plus hardware reviews and setup showcases.

The Indian Flight Simmer, run by Sam, offers tutorials and flight experience videos for P3D, FSX, and MSFS, aimed at helping aspiring virtual pilots learn simulation tools and bridge the gap between virtual and real-world aviation.

## Shops

IFS India is the country's market leader in home cockpit simulation hardware and software, offering USB plug-and-play flight sim panels compatible with MSFS, P3D, X-Plane, and DCS. They serve individual enthusiasts, flight training academies, and even air force training centers.

VKB-SIM India is the official VKB store for the Indian market, selling premium flight simulation joysticks, throttles, and rudder pedals. The store handles import and delivery across India with over 1,200 customer reviews.

Computech Store stocks Thrustmaster, Logitech, and other flight simulation controllers and accessories with competitive pricing in INR and nationwide shipping.

## Training

Flight Simulation Technique Centre (FSTC) is India's largest DGCA and EASA approved training organization, founded in 2012. It offers complete pilot training from single-engine Cessna to A320/B737 type rating on India's largest fleet of full-flight simulators, and is also involved in defence simulation manufacturing.

CAE Simulation Training Private Limited (CSTPL), a joint venture between InterGlobe Enterprises and CAE Inc. in Greater Noida, operates India's largest state-of-the-art pilot training facility with 15 full-flight simulators, 17 bays, and 90,000 annual training hours.

## Events

Flight 4 Fantasy is India's first flight simulation entertainment centre for non-pilots, with locations in Bangalore (Garuda Mall) and Mumbai (Phoenix Marketcity). Visitors can experience Boeing 737, Cessna, and fighter jet simulators, with sessions bookable via BookMyShow.

Wings India is Asia's largest civil aviation exhibition, held at Begumpet Airport in Hyderabad. Organized by India's Ministry of Civil Aviation, AAI, and FICCI, it features aviation technology displays including flight simulation, with the 2026 edition held in January-February.
