## Introduction

Australia boasts one of the most vibrant and well-established flight simulation communities in the Asia-Pacific region. As a vast continent with diverse terrain — from the busy international airports of Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane to remote outback airstrips and challenging approaches into island destinations — Australia offers an exceptional virtual flying environment.

The Australian flight sim scene benefits from world-class add-on developers who call the country home, most notably Orbx and TFDi Design, whose products are used by simmers worldwide. The VATSIM Australia Pacific division (VATPAC) provides comprehensive ATC coverage and serves as the community's central hub, while virtual airlines like QVirtual and Jetstar Virtual bring structured airline operations to Australian skies.

WorldFlight, the annual charity event that has raised over $500,000 for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, exemplifies the Australian community's spirit — combining passion for flight simulation with meaningful charitable giving. The event draws international participation and has become one of the most prestigious events in the global flight sim calendar.

Australia's geographic position in the Oceania timezone creates a tight-knit community where pilots, controllers, and developers regularly collaborate across events, group flights, and development projects.

## ATC Networks

VATPAC (VATSIM Australia Pacific) is the official VATSIM division covering Australian airspace and surrounding Pacific nations. The division provides ATC services across the entire Australian FIR, maintaining an active Discord community that serves as the main hub for coordination, training, and social activities. VATPAC offers comprehensive pilot resources at pilots.vatpac.org, covering everything from radio phraseology to flight planning rules specific to Australian airspace.

IVAO Australia Division offers an alternative online flying network with structured training programs for both pilots and controllers. The division organises World Tour group flights in the Australian timezone, regular tours, and examination programs for virtual pilot and controller certification.

## Virtual Airlines

QVirtual is Australia's premier virtual airline, simulating Qantas operations with over 55,000 schedules covering destinations worldwide. The airline uses smartCARS3 by TFDi Design for precision flight tracking, offering both long-haul and regional routes with a rank progression system. QVirtual operates on the VATSIM network, providing an immersive airline experience.

Jetstar Virtual (vJST) is a professional virtual airline for Australia and New Zealand, operating as a VATSIM certified partner. The airline uses the vAMSYS platform with SimBrief integration for dispatch, automatic PIREP processing, public pilot profiles, leaderboards, and a growing library of pilot resources.

## Communities and Forums

The Oceanic Combat Group (OCG) is Australia's prominent DCS World community, focused on teamwork, quality training, and tactical realism. Members progress from basic formation flying and element integrity to advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground employment, with training built around real-world brevity and tactics. Common airframes include the F/A-18, F-16C, A-10C, F-14B, and F-15C.

VATPAC's Discord server functions as the primary social hub for the broader Australian civilian flight sim community, hosting ATC training sessions, event discussions, townhalls, and social activities.

## Add-on Developers

Orbx, founded in Melbourne in 2006, has grown from a small group creating local Australian airfield scenery into one of the world's most prominent flight simulation developers. With over 350 products spanning MSFS, X-Plane, Prepar3D, and Aerofly FS, Orbx is renowned for high-fidelity scenery. Their AU Australia v2 product covers 8 million square kilometres of the Australian continent, while Cityscape Sydney features over 100 custom points of interest. Orbx was a finalist in the Australian Aviation Awards 2023.

TFDi Design is an Australian flight simulation software company known for developing aircraft add-ons including the MD-11 and Boeing 717 for MSFS. TFDi also created smartCARS, a flight tracking technology used by virtual airlines worldwide, making them a cornerstone of both the development and virtual airline ecosystems.

## Media and Content Creators

LetsFlyvfr is an Australian-based content creator bringing over three decades of flight simulator experience and real-world military aviation background. The site offers VFR flight tutorials, curated YouTube channel discovery pages, and guides for flight simulation enthusiasts.

The Flight Sim Deck is an Australian YouTube channel producing flight simulation content featuring adventures around the globe in simulator cockpits, with an active presence across TikTok, Instagram, and Discord.

## Events

WorldFlight is Australia's flagship flight simulation event, running annually since 1999. Teams fly custom-built full-size cockpits — including Boeing 747-400s and Airbus A330s — on a week-long virtual circumnavigation of the globe starting and ending in Sydney. With nearly 50 flights conducted over 160 hours with full VATSIM ATC coverage, WorldFlight has raised over $500,000 for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The event offers simulator rides in their 747 cockpit, with donations supporting the RFDS.

## Training

Flight Experience Sydney offers Boeing 737 full-motion flight simulator sessions in the heart of Sydney, providing realistic cockpit experiences for aviation enthusiasts, corporate events, and special occasions.

Jet Flight Simulator Perth features a Boeing 787 Dreamliner simulator experience, offering sessions for aviation enthusiasts alongside services for airline recruitment preparation, aerophobia treatment, and vocational guidance.

## Shops

The Gamesmen is a family-owned Australian retailer operating since 1982, stocking a comprehensive range of flight simulation hardware from Thrustmaster, Logitech, and Honeycomb, with expert advice for both beginners and experienced sim pilots.

Player1 Sim Gear specialises in sim racing and flight simulator setups, offering Australia's widest range of simulator packages and turn-key simulators. As the leading Australian partner for Pimax, they also specialise in high-performance VR headsets.
