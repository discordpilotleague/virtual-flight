France holds a leading position in the flight simulation world. Driven by a strong aeronautical tradition — birthplace of Airbus, Dassault Aviation and one of Europe's densest air networks — the French simulation community brings together thousands of enthusiasts across the country.

The French landscape is distinguished by the highly active presence of both major online flying networks, IVAO and VATSIM, which provide regular virtual air traffic control at major French airports. IVAO, whose world headquarters is located in France, enjoys particularly strong popularity among French-speaking pilots and controllers.

The ecosystem is completed by numerous virtual airlines, historic forums like Pilote-Virtuel.com and Simvol, as well as recognized add-on developers such as France VFR and AzurPoly. Whether you're a beginner or experienced virtual pilot, you'll find in this directory the main resources for practicing flight simulation in France.

## Virtual Airlines

France has a large number of virtual airlines, from the most structured to the most casual. **AirFrance Virtuel**, founded in 2011, is the largest French-speaking virtual airline in the world. It replicates Air France-KLM Group operations with a complete career system, real-time flight tracking and a VATSIM ATO training center. **AFKLVirtual**, affiliated with the Passion Aviation association, also offers faithful simulation of Air France-KLM operations across multiple platforms.

**Air Similan** stands out for its ultra-realistic approach, with procedures modeled on real airlines and deep integration with the IVAO network. Based at Paris-CDG and Orly, it serves over 120 destinations. **Lun'Air**, official partner of IVAO and VATSIM, offers over 80,000 scheduled flights and regular group flights.

**FlyTou Virtual**, based in Toulouse-Blagnac, offers a coherent network with a 100% Airbus fleet on MSFS 2024 and X-Plane 12. **Air Bluefox** and **Les Fous Volants** round out the offering with active communities and a friendly atmosphere, ideal for pilots wanting to fly in groups in a relaxed setting.

## Online Networks

France is one of the most active territories on online flying networks. **IVAO France** has nearly 3,000 active members and organizes regular events, including the famous bimonthly Online Days and numerous themed tours (Real Operations, VFR national, Long Haul). The division also offers structured training for virtual pilots and controllers.

The **French vACC**, French section of VATSIM, provides virtual air traffic control over metropolitan airspace. It develops its own procedures in compliance with real practices and trains virtual controllers in the specifics of French airspace.

## Communities and Forums

**Pilote-Virtuel.com** is the historic French-speaking forum for flight simulation, with over 11,000 registered members and more than one million messages. It covers all simulators: MSFS, X-Plane, Prepar3D and DCS, with sections dedicated to piloting, navigation and network flying.

**Simvol**, active since 1998, is another major reference. The site offers news, tutorials and free add-ons for Microsoft Flight Simulator. **FSX-France** brings together over 3,000 members around multi-platform network flying, with regularly organized outings.

**Flight Simulator France** and **FlightPilote** complete the community landscape with forums and discussion spaces dedicated to Microsoft Flight Simulator.

## Add-on Developers

**France VFR**, founded in 2004 in Brittany, is the main French developer of sceneries for flight simulators. Its catalog covers a wide range of airports and detailed landscapes for MSFS, X-Plane and Prepar3D, and is a reference for virtual pilots wanting to fly over France with increased realism.

**AzurPoly**, active since 2011, develops high-fidelity aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Its catalog includes iconic French aircraft such as the Dassault Rafale, C-160 Transall, SEPECAT Jaguar and Fouga Magister, developed in collaboration with pilots and specialists.
