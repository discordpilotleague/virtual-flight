## Introduction

Taiwan has a small but passionate flight simulation community. From the busy Taoyuan International Airport (RCTP) and Songshan Airport (RCSS) to challenging eastern airports like Hualien (RCYU) and Taitung (RCFN), to the island routes of the Penghu archipelago, Taiwan offers diverse and rich scenery for virtual flying.

In terms of virtual ATC networks, VATROC (Virtual Air Traffic Organization of the Republic of China) is the official VATSIM division for Taiwan, responsible for virtual ATC services in the Taipei FIR, providing regular controller coverage on Saturday evenings. The IVAO East Asia division also covers Taiwan airspace and organizes themed tour events including China Airlines routes.

Taiwan's flight simulation add-on development is led by FS Formosa. This team of local flight simulation enthusiasts is dedicated to filling the gap in Taiwan scenery, presenting the beauty of Formosa to global flight simulation players with exquisite PBR materials and flight procedures aligned with the latest aviation data.

## ATC Networks

VATROC (Virtual Air Traffic Organization of the Republic of China) is the Taiwan division of VATSIM Asia-Pacific, responsible for virtual ATC services in the Taipei FIR (RCAA). The organization provides regular ATC coverage on Saturday evenings and welcomes new members to join controller training. Local controllers are required to have basic English reading and writing proficiency, while visiting controllers need Chinese listening and speaking ability.

The IVAO East Asia division (XE) covers airspace management for Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Philippines, and Vietnam. The division organizes events including fly-in tours simulating China Airlines regional routes, as well as VFR tours spanning from Korea to Taiwan. The division is responsible for publishing documents, procedures, and charts, and organizing various events.

## Add-on Developers

FS Formosa is Taiwan's most representative flight simulation scenery development team. The name "Formosa" originates from the admiration of sixteenth-century Portuguese sailors for Taiwan's beauty. This team of local flight simulation enthusiasts focuses on creating high-quality Taiwan airport sceneries for Microsoft Flight Simulator, with works including Penghu Airport (RCQC) and Taichung Shuinan Airport. With the assistance of a local airline pilot, the default instrument flight procedures in MSFS have been rewritten to fully comply with the latest Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP). Free mods are available for download on flightsim.to, while paid sceneries are sold on simMarket.
