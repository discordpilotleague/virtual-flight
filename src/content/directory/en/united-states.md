The United States is home to the largest and most active flight simulation community in the world. With a deep-rooted aviation culture, access to major simulator platforms, and a thriving ecosystem of developers, content creators, and organizations, American flight simmers benefit from an unmatched range of resources.

The US flight sim scene is anchored by VATUSA, the largest division of the VATSIM network, which provides virtual air traffic control across 21 ARTCCs covering the entire national airspace. PilotEdge offers a complementary professional ATC service staffed by live controllers, widely used by both virtual and real-world student pilots. A robust ecosystem of addon developers, from airliner specialists like PMDG to scenery powerhouses like Orbx, ensures that US-based simmers have access to the most detailed and realistic products on the market.

American virtual airlines represent some of the oldest and most established in the hobby, with organizations like Southwest Virtual operating continuously since 1999. Major US carriers including American, Delta, United, Alaska, and even cargo operators like FedEx each have dedicated virtual airline communities with thousands of available routes and active pilot bases. The annual FlightSimExpo convention draws thousands of enthusiasts, while online communities like AVSIM and r/flightsim connect hundreds of thousands of simmers daily.

## ATC Networks

**VATUSA**, the United States division of VATSIM, is the largest and most active division on the network. It encompasses 21 Air Route Traffic Control Centers, providing virtual ATC coverage from coast to coast. VATUSA offers structured controller training programs and regular events that draw hundreds of participants.

**PilotEdge** provides a unique alternative with professional, paid ATC service covering the western United States. Live human controllers staff positions 15 hours a day, 7 days a week, creating a consistently realistic environment. PilotEdge is endorsed by flight schools and used by real-world student pilots to practice radio communications and procedures.

## Virtual Airlines

The United States boasts some of the most established virtual airlines in the hobby. **American Virtual**, with over 20 years of experience, offers more than 30,000 schedules replicating American Airlines operations, along with a unique rewards program. **Southwest Virtual**, in continuous operation since 1999, is one of the longest-running virtual airlines in existence and focuses on simulating Southwest Airlines with attention to realism.
