## Introduction

Hong Kong has an active flight simulation community, benefiting from its unique aviation environment. Hong Kong International Airport (VHHH) is one of the world's busiest cargo hubs and serves as the main base for Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Airlines, HK Express, and Hong Kong Air Cargo. The former Kai Tak Airport (VHHX), with its legendary Runway 13 approach requiring a 47-degree right turn over Kowloon, remains a classic scenario for flight simulation enthusiasts.

In virtual ATC networks, VATSIM Hong Kong vACC has grown consistently since its establishment in 2006, becoming an active force within VATSIM Southeast Asia. IVAO East Asia division also covers Hong Kong airspace, organizing regional fly-in events and controller training.

Oasis Hong Kong Virtual is Hong Kong's local virtual airline dedicated to building the local flight simulation community. The organization supports both VATSIM and IVAO networks and provides liveries for popular add-on aircraft.

Hong Kong also has several professional-grade flight simulation facilities. Aero 320, founded by local airline pilots and approved by Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department, offers airline-standard A320 flight training. Aerosim provides flight simulation experiences based on the Diamond DA 40, allowing the public to experience realistic flight operations.

## ATC Networks

VATSIM Hong Kong vACC is Hong Kong's virtual Area Control Centre, established in 2006 under VATSIM Southeast Asia (VATSEA). The organization provides virtual ATC services for Hong Kong Flight Information Region, covering Chek Lap Kok International Airport (VHHH) and Macau International Airport (VMMC). Since its establishment, it has grown year after year and has become one of the most active branches under VATSEA. Joining requires selecting Asia Pacific region and Southeast Asia division when registering on VATSIM.

IVAO East Asia division (XE) manages airspace including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Philippines, and Vietnam. The division publishes documentation, charts, and procedures, and organizes cross-regional fly-in tours and various events.

## Virtual Airlines

Oasis Hong Kong Virtual (VOHK) is Hong Kong's virtual airline dedicated to promoting the development of the local flight simulation community. The OHK callsign is increasingly active on both VATSIM and IVAO flight simulation networks. VOHK provides liveries for popular add-on aircraft including PMDG 737, 777, 747v3, and Aerosoft AirbusX Extended.

## Training

Aero 320 is a professional flight training equipment provider in Hong Kong, founded by local airline pilots to provide airline-standard professional flight training. Approved by the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department (HKCAD), Aero 320's courses cover real international airline operating procedures using high-fidelity A320 flight training devices.

Aerosim provides a flight simulator called "Aero Cadet," modeled after the Diamond DA 40 line training aircraft with highly realistic cockpit replication. Participants can operate at multiple locations, experiencing challenging airport environments and extreme weather conditions, suitable for aviation enthusiasts and those aspiring to pursue flying careers.
