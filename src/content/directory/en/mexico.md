## Introduction

Mexico has a growing flight simulation community, supported by the richness of its real-world airspace — from the busy Mexico City International Airport to the coastal airports of Cancun and Los Cabos, and the mountain routes threading between the Sierra Madre Occidental and Oriental ranges.

Both major virtual flying networks maintain an official presence in Mexico. VATMEX, the Mexican division of VATSIM, provides virtual ATC services and ongoing training, while IVAO Mexico offers a structured environment with certification programs and special operations. Both networks sustain active communities with regular events covering Mexican airspace.

Mexican scenery development has been led by FlyMex Software since 1996, producing detailed recreations of the country's major airports for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The community also benefits from media resources such as Transponder 1200, Mexico's leading Spanish-language aviation media outlet covering both real and virtual aviation.

## ATC Networks

VATMEX is the Mexican division of VATSIM, part of the AMAS (Americas) region. The division provides virtual ATC services across all Mexican airspace, with ongoing training for controllers and pilots. VATMEX maintains an active presence on social media and Discord, organizes regular events, and develops proprietary applications to enhance the virtual air traffic experience.

IVAO Mexico is the Mexican division of the International Virtual Aviation Organization, with structured training programs for pilots and controllers. The division features a Special Operations Department (SOD) and organizes tours, certification exams, and events covering Mexican airports such as AICM (MMMX) and Cancun (MMUN).

## Communities

SEMARV (Secretaria de Marina Virtual) is a unique flight simulation group that replicates the aeronaval operations of the Mexican Navy. Operating on both the IVAO and VATSIM networks, SEMARV simulates flights with fixed-wing and rotary aircraft across various scenarios throughout Mexican airspace, extending into Central America, the Caribbean, and other regions. The organization also functions as an SOG (Special Operations Group) under the rules of the IVAO Special Operations Division.

## Add-on Developers

FlyMex Software is the most recognized Mexican scenery developer, active since 1996. Their flagship product is Mexico City International Airport (MMMX) for MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024, featuring detailed terminals, accurate taxiways, and night lighting effects. The Aeropuertos de Mexico series also includes Cozumel (MMCZ) and Monterrey, with new projects in continuous development.

## Media

Transponder 1200 is Mexico's leading aviation media outlet, founded in 2011. With a team of 11 to 50 contributors, it covers real and virtual aviation news including flight simulators, interviews with Mexican developers such as SimFlightTechnologies, coverage of events like FAMEX, and comparative articles on virtual flying networks such as VATSIM and IVAO.

## Shops

Flight Sim e Shop, based in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, is a specialized shop offering high-quality flight simulators. It serves both enthusiasts and professionals with products ranging from seated simulator platforms to audio panels and expansion packs. The shop provides expert engineering support for setup, software installation, and scenery configuration.
