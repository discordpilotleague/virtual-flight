Brazil has one of the most vibrant and active flight simulation communities in the world. Among the top five countries in VATSIM and IVAO traffic, the country combines vast continental geography, a national passion for aviation and a highly organized virtual pilot community.

The Brazilian presence is supported by two consolidated international networks: VATSIM Brazil and IVAO Brasil. Both offer frequent ATC coverage at major hubs like Guarulhos (SBGR), Galeão (SBGL) and Brasília (SBBR), plus structured training programs for pilots and controllers.

The scene is complemented by virtual airlines representing the country's major carriers, scenery developers reproducing Brazilian airport complexity, local simulation hardware manufacturers and a growing community of Portuguese-language content creators.
