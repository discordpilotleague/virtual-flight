## Introduction

Portugal has an active and growing flight simulation community, fueled by the richness of its real airspace — from the busy Humberto Delgado Airport in Lisbon and Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport in Porto to the challenging island airports of Madeira and the Azores, and the coastal routes of the Algarve.

Both major virtual flying networks have an official presence in Portugal. Portugal vACC, integrated within VATEUD (VATSIM Europe Division), provides virtual air traffic control services in the Lisbon and Santa Maria FIRs. IVAO Portugal complements the offering with its own certification programs and regular operations.

The Portuguese community is distinguished by Flight Simulator Portugal (FSP), the country's largest and longest-established flight simulation community, which offers FSP-Virtual as a flying platform with its own tracking and logging system. Virtual airlines TAP Virtual and vTP Virtual allow virtual pilots to fly in Portuguese colors around the world.

Portugal also has several high-fidelity physical simulation experiences, from Lusitania Flight Center's Airbus A320 simulator to Flight Mode Simulations' Boeing 737-800 in the Algarve, offering enthusiasts the opportunity to experience piloting in an immersive environment.

## ATC Networks

Portugal vACC is the Portuguese division of VATSIM, part of VATEUD (VATSIM Europe Division). The division provides virtual air traffic control services in the Lisbon (LPPC) and Santa Maria FIRs, covering all Portuguese continental airspace, Madeira, and the Azores. Controllers use EuroScope with the community-developed TopSky adaptation, and AIRAC navigation data is made freely available through the AeroNav Association.

IVAO Portugal is the Portuguese division of the International Virtual Aviation Organization, offering structured training programs for pilots and controllers. IVAO's progressive rating system allows new pilots to progress from solo flight to VFR, IFR, and advanced qualifications, with practical examinations conducted by instructors.

## Virtual Airlines

TAP Virtual is a virtual airline inspired by TAP Air Portugal, the country's flagship carrier. Following the structure and procedures of the real airline, TAP Virtual brings together flight simulation enthusiasts around a project that allows them to fly in national colors with realistic routes worldwide.

vTP Virtual is a virtual airline designed for flight simulation pilots looking to explore global destinations from Portugal. Using the VAMSYS platform for flight tracking, vTP offers routes from the Portuguese coast to cities across Europe, Africa, and beyond.

FSP-Virtual, integrated within the Flight Simulator Portugal community, also operates as a virtual airline with the FSPAcars system for flight tracking, including routes from TAP Air Portugal and other carriers.

## Communities

Flight Simulator Portugal (FSP) is the largest and most prestigious flight simulation community in Portugal. Active for several years, FSP offers free downloads of aircraft, scenery, textures, and programs for MSFS, X-Plane, P3D, and FSX. The community maintains an active forum in Portuguese, the FSP-Virtual platform for multiplayer flying, and open applications for new pilots.

## Training

Lusitania Flight Center offers simulation sessions in a high-fidelity Airbus A320, providing a piloting experience with real-time weather and online air traffic control.

FlightConcept provides realistic and immersive flight simulators for aviation enthusiasts, corporate events, and special occasions.

Flight Mode Simulations, located in the Algarve, offers a Boeing 737-800 flight simulator with a panoramic cockpit, providing an immersive piloting experience in one of Portugal's most visited regions.
