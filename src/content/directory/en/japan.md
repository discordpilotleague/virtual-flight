## Introduction

Japan's flight simulation community reflects a deep interest in technology and rich aviation culture, making it one of the largest and most diverse in Asia. Users of major simulators including Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS), X-Plane, and DCS World are highly active, with a broad ecosystem ranging from online ATC networks to virtual airlines and authentic simulator experience centers.

VATJPN, Japan's VATSIM division, stands at the center of Japanese online flight simulation activities. Through regular events, controller training programs, and extensive pilot resources, it provides a venue for realistic air traffic control simulation.

In the virtual airline space, Japan Airlines Virtual and ANA Virtual Group operate internationally, recreating the operations of Japan's major carriers. The Japan-born Stay Home Airlines draws attention with its unique approach of running its own private ATC network.

Media activities, primarily on YouTube, are also thriving, with channels like Taitan_F (over 73,000 subscribers) and CaptainRyu (an active airline captain) delivering highly specialized content in Japanese. Additionally, authentic flight simulator experience centers exist in Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe, and other cities, where you can enjoy flight experiences under the guidance of professional pilots.

## ATC Networks

The center of Japanese online ATC networks is VATJPN. As Japan's VATSIM division, it provides realistic air traffic control simulation within the Japan FIR. Controller examination and training programs are available, allowing you to progressively develop your skills.

For IVAO, there is no independent Japanese division, but the IVAO East Asia Region (XE Division) covers the Japan FIR (Fukuoka FIR), enabling participation in online ATC activities within Japanese airspace.

## Virtual Airlines

Japan Airlines Virtual is one of Asia's largest virtual airlines, founded in 2007, recreating JAL Group operations with over 300 aircraft. With eight hub airports — Narita, Haneda, Kansai, Osaka, Chitose, Fukuoka, Naha, and Chubu — it supports flights on both VATSIM and IVAO.

ANA Virtual Group recreates All Nippon Airways Group operations (AirDo, Air Japan, IBEX, etc.) and launched its v3 platform in December 2024. Stay Home Airlines is a Japan-born, Japanese-operated VA that offers realistic flights with air traffic control through its own ATC network, SHAPANet.

## Communities and Forums

For MSFS, the Steam community group Microsoft Flight Simulator Japan serves as a hub for Japanese information sharing and multiplayer. The Microsoft Flight Simulator Japanese Wiki is a community-run reference site aggregating tutorials and add-on information, widely used by many users.

DCS World-related communities are also robust, with DCS: Freedom Flight Server as Japan's largest DCS Discord community, running 24/7 multiplayer servers, hosting COOP events, and providing beginner training. DCS:World Wiki is a comprehensive Japanese reference covering everything from installation guides to aircraft operations.

5channel's Flight Sim Board remains a popular venue for Japanese information exchange about MSFS, DCS World, X-Plane, and other simulators. FLIGHT INFO has been delivering comprehensive Japanese flight simulation information for many years.

Japan Virtual Soaring Club is a community specializing in glider simulation with Condor Soaring Simulator, hosting weekly flight events and a Monthly Challenge.

## Add-on Developers

TechnoBrain is Japan's leading flight simulator add-on development company, having released MSFS sceneries of Kansai International Airport and Yao Airport. They are currently developing an MSFS version of Tokyo International Airport (Haneda). Also widely known as the developer of the "I am an Air Traffic Controller" series.

RAZBAM JAPAN is the Japanese subsidiary of RAZBAM Simulations Inc., developing high-quality aircraft modules for DCS World (F-15E Strike Eagle, AV-8B Harrier, Mirage 2000C, etc.). They also serve as the Japanese representative for VIRPIL Controls and are expanding into rental services for flight simulation-related events.

## Media and Content Creators

Machikado Flight Academy is a unique facility in Yokohama where five former international airline pilots serve as instructors, offering flight training using MSFS2020 and X-Plane12. FS-CIMA is a specialized facility with Japan Civil Aviation Bureau-certified flight training devices, also catering to pilot recruitment test preparation.

The Museum of Aeronautical Sciences is adjacent to Narita Airport, an experience-oriented museum where visitors can operate converted DC-8 training simulators, B737-MAX, and B777 simulators.
