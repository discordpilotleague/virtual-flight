## Introduction

Argentina has a well-established and passionate flight simulation community, fueled by the richness of its airspace — from the busy Ezeiza International Airport and Jorge Newbery Aeroparque in Buenos Aires to the Patagonian airports of Ushuaia and El Calafate, along with Andean mountain routes and airfields across the Pampas.

Both major virtual flight networks maintain an official presence in Argentina. VATSIM Argentina, part of VATSUR (the VATSIM South American division), covers Argentina's five FIR with ongoing training and monthly events. IVAO Argentina complements the offering with its own certification programs and regular operations.

The Argentine community stands out for its collaborative spirit. Flight Simulator Argentina has developed thousands of free add-ons since the earliest versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator, while communities such as Fuerza Aérea Argentina Virtual recreate Argentine military operations with dedication in the virtual environment.

## ATC Networks

VATSIM Argentina is the Argentine subdivision of VATSUR, the VATSIM division for South America. It provides virtual air traffic control services across Argentina's five FIR: Ezeiza, Córdoba, Mendoza, Resistencia, and Comodoro Rivadavia. The division offers theoretical and practical training for both pilots and controllers, with rank advancement courses and monthly events providing full ATC coverage in selected airspaces.

IVAO Argentina is the Argentine division of the International Virtual Aviation Organization. It offers structured training programs with dedicated software such as Altitude for pilots, certification exams at Argentine airports like SAEZ (Ezeiza) and SABE (Aeroparque), and support for MSFS, X-Plane, and Prepar3D through the MTL (Multiplayer Traffic Library).

## Virtual Airlines

Aerolíneas Virtual is an Argentine virtual airline simulating air operations through Microsoft Flight Simulator and X-Plane. Completely unrelated to Aerolíneas Argentinas S.A., this non-profit organization provides an organized virtual flying experience with routes, a pilot system, and flight tracking.

## Communities

Flight Simulator Argentina (FSA) is one of the oldest and most active flight simulation communities in Argentina. They have designed thousands of free add-ons for the Microsoft Flight Simulator series since its earliest versions, as well as for X-Plane and Prepar3D. The community provides a free Spanish-language Discord server for multiplayer online flights on IVAO and VATSIM, a virtual flight school for beginners, aeronautical charts, tutorials, and aviation-dedicated weather resources.

Fuerza Aérea Argentina Virtual (FAAV) is a military aviation simulation group dedicated to recreating, with respect and admiration, the activities of the Argentine Air Force. Registered with VATSIM since 2022 and a member of IVAO Special Operations since 2015, the FAAV simulates operations with historic and current Argentine combat aircraft in a spirit of camaraderie.

Flight Simulator República Argentina is another active Argentine community dedicated to flight simulation, featuring online flights, resources for virtual pilots, and a Spanish-language forum.

## Media

Volemos is a Spanish-language virtual aviation portal covering news, guides, and resources about flight simulation, including information about online flight networks such as VATSIM and IVAO, and resources for the Spanish-speaking simulation community.

## Shops

TMA Simuladores is an Argentine company specializing in flight simulators, offering professional and recreational simulation platforms, flight hardware, and custom solutions for aeronautical training and entertainment.
