## Introduction

Switzerland offers an exceptional environment for flight simulation, with airspace that ranks among the most interesting in Europe. From the demanding approaches to Zurich (LSZH), the country's largest airport, to mountain airstrips like Sion (LSGS) and Saanen-Gstaad (LSGK), and including Geneva (LSGG) and Basel-Mulhouse (LFSB), the Alpine nation provides a remarkable diversity of flight scenarios.

Both major online flying networks are well represented in Switzerland. vACC Switzerland, the Swiss VATSIM division, offers virtual air traffic control services across all Swiss airports with comprehensive training for beginners. IVAO Switzerland, with over 2,400 members, provides structured training programs and tours to discover the country from the skies.

SWISS Virtual, a non-profit association based in Zurich, is the country's primary virtual airline and simulates SWISS International Air Lines operations. The Swiss community also gathers around ILS Flightforum, the main German-language forum dedicated to flight simulation in Switzerland, and vSAF (virtuelle Swiss Air Force) for military simulation.

The country also benefits from physical simulation experiences, such as JM Simulation's Boeing 737-700 simulator in Lausanne, and specialist shops like Pilotshop.ch for home cockpit equipment.

## ATC Networks

vACC Switzerland is the Swiss division of the VATSIM network, integrated within the VATSIM Europe Division (VATEUD). It covers all Swiss airports, from Zurich, one of Europe's largest airports, to Geneva and Basel-Mulhouse through regional airfields like Bern, Sion, and Lugano. Controller training is progressive, from Delivery positions through to Radar Centre, with no prerequisites other than willingness to learn.

IVAO Switzerland is the Swiss division of the International Virtual Aviation Organisation, counting over 2,400 members. The training department teaches from basics through to complex operations, the flight department prepares tours to discover Switzerland and other destinations, and the ATC department ensures all simulated operations follow real-world procedures.

## Virtual Airlines

SWISS Virtual is a non-profit association based at Zurich Airport, offering a realistic simulation environment based on SWISS International Air Lines operations. Membership is optional and not required to participate as a virtual pilot. The airline uses the vAMSYS system for flight tracking and supports MSFS, X-Plane, and Prepar3D.

## Communities

ILS Flightforum is Switzerland's main flight simulation forum, run by the Interessengemeinschaft Luftfahrt Schweiz (ILS). The forum covers all aspects of flight simulation, from hardware recommendations to home cockpit building, screenshot sharing, and a used equipment marketplace. The forum also organises the Flightsim Weekend, an annual event in Hergiswil where flight simulation enthusiasts gather to meet manufacturers and developers.

vSAF (virtuelle Swiss Air Force) is a Swiss military simulation community that recreates Swiss Air Force operations. It actively participates in Swiss community events, particularly the FlightSim Weekend.

## Training

JM Simulation offers a Boeing 737-700 NG flight simulator at Lausanne Airport. Sessions are designed for aviation enthusiasts, people working on aerophobia, as well as professional pilots seeking additional training in a high-fidelity cockpit.

## Shops

Pilotshop.ch is a Swiss shop offering aviation equipment and flight simulation hardware. The catalogue includes Honeycomb flight controllers, USB adapters, Cockpit Master panels, and various accessories for home cockpit building.
