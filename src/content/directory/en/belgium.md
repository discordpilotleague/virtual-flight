## Introduction

Belgium has an active flight simulation community, driven by its strategic position in the heart of Europe and the richness of its airspace. From Brussels National Airport (EBBR), hub of Brussels Airlines and TUI Fly Belgium, to Brussels South Charleroi Airport (EBCI), and including the aerodromes of Antwerp (EBAW), Ostend-Bruges (EBOS) and military bases like Kleine Brogel (EBBL), the country offers an interesting variety of flight scenarios despite its small size.

The two main online flying networks cover Belgian airspace through joint divisions with Luxembourg. The Belux vACC provides virtual air traffic control services on VATSIM in the Brussels FIR, while IVAO BeLux, registered as a Belgian non-profit organization since 2007, offers its own training and certification programs.

The Flight Simulator Club Belgium brings together Belgian flight simulation enthusiasts around a dedicated club. Belgium is also distinguished by its numerous high-quality physical simulation centers, with facilities like Brussels Flight Simulators in Zaventem, European Flight Simulator and Flight Experience in Nivelles, offering flight experiences accessible to the general public.

## ATC Networks

The Belux vACC is the Belgian and Luxembourg division of the VATSIM network, integrated into the VATSIM Europe Division (VATEUD). It provides virtual air traffic control services in the Brussels FIR, covering the airports of Brussels National, Charleroi, Antwerp, Ostend and Luxembourg. Controller training is progressive and entirely based on self-learning for the first levels, without prerequisites.

IVAO BeLux is the Belgian and Luxembourg division of the International Virtual Aviation Organisation. Registered as a Belgian non-profit organization since 2007, IVAO offers live ATC guidance, airport information and training programs for virtual pilots. The division organizes regular events and offers structured certification programs.

## Communities

Flight Simulator Club Belgium (FSCB) is a Belgian club dedicated to flight simulation, bringing together enthusiasts of all levels around a space for exchange and sharing. The club welcomes virtual pilots using different simulation platforms.

## Training

Brussels Flight Simulators (BFSIM), founded in 2016 and located in Zaventem near Brussels Airport, is the largest flight simulation center open to the public in Belgium. Its four high-performance simulators — Boeing 737, F-16 Falcon, F-18 Super Hornet and Beechcraft Baron 58 — share the same virtual airspace, allowing aircraft to see each other and interact during specific flights and missions.

European Flight Simulator (EFS), founded by two airline pilots, is the first flight simulator in Belgium to open its doors to the general public in 2013. EFS allows anyone to take control of a Boeing 737 simulator without any prior knowledge required.

Flight Experience, located in Nivelles, offers military and civil flight simulators, including F-14, F-16, F-18 and Airbus A320. It is Belgium's most realistic and immersive commercial F-16 simulator, open to individuals, groups, families and professional pilots.
