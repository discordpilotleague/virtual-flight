There is a particular satisfaction in watching a developer take the least glamorous member of an aircraft family and give it the same uncompromising attention as its bigger siblings. The 737-600 was never the headline act. It was the shortest, lightest, and least-ordered variant in the Next Generation lineup -- a compact workhorse that served a handful of airlines on thin European and North African routes before quietly fading from production after just 69 airframes. Yesterday, [PMDG](https://pmdg.com/) released the 737-600 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the result is a product that treats this overlooked variant with a level of care that rivals anything in the study-level ecosystem. Priced at $34.99 USD -- with a 60% discount for existing MSFS 2020 owners -- it arrives alongside 23 downloadable liveries and a feature set that leaves very little on the table.

## The Real 737-600: A Short History of a Short Airplane

To appreciate what PMDG has built, it helps to understand what the 737-600 actually was. Boeing launched the Next Generation 737 family in the mid-1990s as a comprehensive replacement for the 737 Classic series. The -600 was the direct successor to the 737-500, the smallest Classic variant, and was designed to serve routes where demand did not justify a larger aircraft but where jet performance and reliability were still required. It seated between 108 and 132 passengers depending on configuration, powered by a pair of CFM International CFM56-7 series turbofans -- the same engine family that powered the rest of the NG line.

Scandinavian Airlines System placed the launch order in 1995, and the first 737-600 took flight on January 22, 1998, entering revenue service later that year. SAS was the natural customer: its Scandinavian network included numerous short-to-medium routes with moderate passenger loads, and the -600's economics fit those sectors precisely. Other operators included Air Algerie, Air China, Tunisair, and Malev Hungarian Airlines -- a roster that reflects the aircraft's niche appeal. Airlines that needed more capacity bought the -700 or -800 instead, and many that might have ordered the -600 simply kept their existing 737-500s a few years longer.

Production ended in 2006 after only 69 aircraft had been built, making it far and away the rarest NG variant. The -800, by comparison, sold over 4,900 units. But rarity does not equate to insignificance. The 737-600 represented the engineering floor of the NG family: every system, every structural solution, every cockpit procedure was shared with its larger siblings, just wrapped in a shorter fuselage. For simmers interested in the pure flying experience of the NG without the complexity of high-density operations, the -600 offers something distinct.

## What PMDG Has Built

### Exterior Model: Lidar Precision

PMDG's exterior model is built from lidar-scanned data, which means the geometry is not approximated from photographs or general arrangement drawings but captured at millimeter resolution from an actual airframe. The result is a level of dimensional accuracy that reveals itself in subtle ways: the curvature of the engine nacelles, the exact spacing of the wing leading-edge slats, the slight asymmetries that exist in any real aircraft. A scheduled exterior model update covering the -600, -800, and -900 variants is expected in late February to early March, which suggests PMDG is continuing to refine this already impressive foundation.

### Cockpit and Avionics: Study-Level Depth

The cockpit is where PMDG's reputation was built, and the 737-600 continues that standard. The instrument panel features ultra-high-detail textures that resolve clearly at any zoom level, with accurate-resolution displays that render the Primary Flight Display, Navigation Display, and Engine Indicating pages at native resolution rather than scaling a lower-resolution image. The difference matters: text is sharp, symbology is crisp, and at close range in VR, the displays read like the real equipment.

The Head-Up Display is implemented with configurable modes, projecting flight guidance, speed, and altitude information onto a combiner glass with correct optical behavior. This is not a decorative overlay -- it is a functional tool that supports HUD-referenced approaches and departure procedures, matching the capability of the real Collins HGS system that many 737 operators installed.

### Tablet Displays and Datalink Integration

Each pilot position has a tablet display that functions as an Electronic Flight Bag. These tablets are compatible with Navigraph, allowing pilots to display interactive charts, airport diagrams, and approach plates directly in the cockpit. The datalink system integrates with simBrief for flight plan import and with SayIntentions AI for automated ATC communication, creating a workflow that closely mirrors real-world connected flight deck operations.

The practical benefit is significant. Rather than alt-tabbing to external applications for chart reference or manually entering flight plans, pilots can manage the entire operational workflow from within the cockpit environment. For pilots flying on VATSIM or IVAO where procedural accuracy matters, this level of integration reduces workload and increases immersion.

### Flight Controls and Systems Simulation

The flight control system is modeled in full: normal mode with hydraulic power, standby mode for degraded operations, and reversionary mode for system failures. The landing gear system follows the same philosophy, with normal extension and retraction, alternate extension procedures, and the associated hydraulic and electrical logic. These are not abstract states that trigger canned animations -- they are interconnected systems where the loss of a hydraulic pump or an electrical bus produces cascading effects that the pilot must diagnose and manage using the correct procedures.

The custom flight model features enhanced physics that go beyond the default MSFS aerodynamic calculations. Rigid body physics for the wing and tail structures mean that structural flex and load distribution are simulated, affecting handling qualities in turbulence and during maneuvering flight. The result is an aircraft that feels connected to the air mass in a way that simpler flight models do not achieve.

### Failure Simulation: When Things Go Wrong

PMDG has implemented a full Quick Reference Handbook scenario-based failure simulation system. This is not a simple menu where you select "engine fire" and watch the warning light illuminate. The failure modeling uses real-world mean-time-to-failure data, meaning that components degrade and fail according to statistical models derived from actual 737 maintenance records. An electrical generator might fail during cruise. A hydraulic pump might lose pressure on approach. A display unit might blank during a critical phase of flight.

The QRH integration means that each failure triggers the correct checklist response, and the aircraft systems behave consistently with the failure state. Manage it correctly using the published procedures, and you recover. Miss a step or apply the wrong checklist, and the situation can compound. This is where the 737-600's study-level depth becomes genuinely educational -- it teaches the same diagnostic and procedural skills that real-world pilots practice in full-motion simulators.

### Cabin Interior and Ground Operations

PMDG has built a fully integrated cabin interior with both passenger and cargo configurations. The passenger cabin supports single-class and two-class seating arrangements, and the level of detail extends to individual seat models, overhead bins, and cabin lighting. Operable doors connect the cockpit to the cabin, and the lighting system models both incandescent and LED packages, reflecting the different interior refurbishment states that real 737-600s carried over their service lives.

The cargo variant is included, along with a BBJ (Boeing Business Jet) cockpit variant, expanding the operational scenarios available to the pilot. The full ground equipment set -- GPU, air start unit, stairs, baggage loaders -- completes the ramp environment, allowing for realistic turnaround procedures from gate arrival through pushback.

### Sound Environment

The 3D sound environment is entirely new, recorded from a purpose-instrumented aircraft. This is not a library of generic jet sounds mapped to different engine states. PMDG captured the specific acoustic signature of the CFM56-7 at various power settings, the cockpit ambient noise at different altitudes and configurations, the hydraulic actuator sounds during gear and flap operation, and the subtle environmental cues -- rain on the windscreen, wind noise variations with speed -- that contribute to an immersive aural experience. The difference between recorded-from-aircraft sound and synthesized sound is immediately apparent, particularly during the startup sequence where each engine has a distinctive spool-up character.

### Lighting and Visual Design

The lighting system supports both incandescent and LED configurations, and the night environment benefits considerably from this attention. Cockpit flood lighting, panel backlighting, and the interaction between internal and external light sources are all modeled with care. For pilots who enjoy night operations -- and the 737-600's Scandinavian heritage means plenty of dark winter flying -- the visual quality during evening departures and approaches is a genuine highlight.

## Liveries and Variants

The 23 free downloadable liveries are distributed through the PMDG Operations Center 3.0, which serves as the centralized hub for PMDG product management, updates, and livery installation. The livery selection covers the aircraft's real-world operators and provides enough variety for route-appropriate flying. SAS liveries are naturally well represented, but the collection extends to schemes from Air Algerie, Tunisair, and other operators that put the -600 into service.

The cargo and BBJ cockpit variants extend the product beyond standard airline operations. The BBJ variant is particularly interesting for simmers who enjoy long-range executive flying -- the -600 fuselage combined with the NG wing's fuel capacity created a surprisingly capable long-range platform in its BBJ configuration.

## Pricing and Availability

The 737-600 is available now at the PMDG Store and through the in-sim MSFS Marketplace at $34.99 USD. Existing owners of the PMDG 737 for MSFS 2020 receive a 60% discount, bringing the upgrade price to under $15 -- an aggressive loyalty pricing strategy that rewards PMDG's established customer base. The product requires MSFS 2024 on PC; there is no Xbox version at this time.

PMDG includes a full tutorial that walks pilots through every phase of flight from power-up to power-down. For newcomers to the 737 or to study-level aircraft in general, this tutorial provides the structured learning path that transforms an intimidatingly complex cockpit into a comprehensible and rewarding environment.

## What It Means for the Community

The 737-600 release is quietly significant. In a market dominated by the -800 and -900 variants, PMDG's decision to model the -600 demonstrates a commitment to completeness that benefits the entire simulation community. The -600 offers a different operational character: shorter sectors, smaller airports, lighter loads, and the kind of point-to-point European flying that does not require three hours of oceanic cruise. For virtual airlines that model realistic SAS or Tunisair operations, the -600 fills a gap that no other product addressed.

The pricing structure also sends a signal. At $34.99 with a substantial loyalty discount, PMDG is positioning the -600 as an accessible entry point into their NG ecosystem. A simmer who has never flown a PMDG product can acquire a complete study-level 737 for less than many mid-range add-ons, and the systems knowledge transfers directly to every other variant in the PMDG 737 family.

The baby Boeing may have been overlooked by the airlines, but in the virtual world, it has received the full treatment. Every system modeled, every rivet scanned, every sound recorded from the real thing. That is what study-level means when it is done right.
