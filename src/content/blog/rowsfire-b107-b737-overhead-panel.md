There is a moment in every home cockpit builder's journey where reaching up to click a virtual overhead switch with a mouse cursor starts to feel absurd. The throttle quadrant is physical, the yoke responds to your hands, the rudder pedals are under your feet -- but the overhead panel, that dense grid of switches and annunciators that governs every major aircraft system, remains trapped behind a flat screen. [Rowsfire](https://rowsfire.com/) has built its reputation on solving exactly this problem, and with the B107 Boeing 737 Overhead Panel, the company extends its product line from the Airbus world into Boeing territory for the first time. Priced at $699.99 USD -- with early bird pricing that brought it down to $559.99 during January -- the B107 began shipping on February 25, 2026, and represents a compelling option for 737 cockpit builders who want metal construction and broad simulator compatibility without the four-figure price tags of professional-grade panels.

## The Overhead Panel: Why It Matters

For pilots who have never sat in a real 737 cockpit, it is easy to underestimate the overhead panel's role. This is not a secondary display -- it is the nerve center for every major aircraft system. Electrical power generation and distribution, hydraulic systems, fuel management, pressurization, anti-ice, lighting, engine start sequences, fire protection: all of these are controlled from the overhead. In the real aircraft, the overhead panel stretches across the full width of the cockpit ceiling and contains over a hundred switches, rotaries, and annunciator lights.

During normal operations, many of these switches are set once and left alone. But during abnormal situations -- an engine fire, a hydraulic failure, an electrical bus fault -- the overhead becomes the center of attention. The pilot's ability to reach up and manipulate the correct switch without hesitation can be the difference between a managed emergency and a cascading failure. For simmers who fly with [PMDG's study-level 737](/blog/pmdg-737-600-msfs-2024/) or the Zibo Mod, where system failures are modeled in genuine depth, a physical overhead panel transforms the experience from menu navigation into procedural flying.

## What Rowsfire Has Built

### Metal Construction and Material Quality

The B107's most immediately apparent quality is its construction. Where many simulator peripherals in this price range use injection-molded plastic housings, Rowsfire has opted for a full metal enclosure with an aluminum alloy frame. The result is a panel that feels substantial in the hand -- at 2.8 kg, it has the kind of heft that inspires confidence rather than concern. The front face uses 4 mm thick acrylic with high-definition printing and a protective laminated surface, which means the switch labels and system group markings are crisp, durable, and unlikely to fade with use.

The overall dimensions -- 405 x 285 x 60 mm -- make the B107 a compact overhead section rather than a full-width cockpit replica. This is a deliberate design choice. A full-scale 737 overhead panel would be impractical for desktop mounting and would require a dedicated overhead structure. The B107 concentrates the most operationally relevant switches and controls into a format that works both on a desk and mounted above a monitor using standard VESA hardware.

### Switches and Controls

The switch selection uses high-performance components with travel-type buttons and high-power LEDs throughout. Several switches feature automatic return behavior -- spring-loaded positions that snap back when released -- to mirror the real aircraft's switch logic. This matters more than it might seem: in the real 737, momentary switches for engine start, ground power connection, and certain test functions behave differently from maintained switches for system selection. Getting this right means that muscle memory developed on the B107 transfers correctly to the procedures.

The layout follows the Boeing 737 overhead organization, with clearly labeled switch groups for quick visual identification during high-workload phases of flight. While the panel does not include every switch found on the full-scale overhead -- fully realistic landing light switches, navigation switches, and fuel switches are not present in the Standard Edition -- the coverage is comprehensive enough for the vast majority of operational scenarios.

### LED Backlighting

The built-in backlight system is one of the B107's strongest features. The LEDs provide uniform, soft brightness across the entire panel face, ensuring that every label and switch position is readable in any lighting condition. For pilots who enjoy night flying -- and anyone building a [home cockpit](/blog/building-home-cockpit-budget-guide/) with ambient lighting control -- the backlighting transforms the B107 from a functional input device into a genuinely atmospheric cockpit element.

The effect during a dark-cockpit session is striking. With room lights dimmed and the panel glowing overhead, the visual and tactile combination creates an immersion level that no on-screen representation can match. The LED implementation is bright enough to be functional but restrained enough to avoid the toy-like glow that plagues some backlit peripherals.

### Mounting Options

The B107 uses a standard 100 x 100 mm VESA mount pattern on its rear panel, which is the same mounting standard used by the Rowsfire A107 Airbus overhead. This is a smart decision: it means the B107 integrates directly with any existing VESA-compatible arm, bracket, or overhead structure. Pilots who already own an A107 and want to switch between Airbus and Boeing can use the same mounting hardware.

For desktop users, the panel sits flat on any stable surface. The weight and rubber feet keep it in place during operation, and the compact dimensions mean it does not dominate a desk the way a full-width panel would.

## Software and Compatibility

### Dual-Driver Architecture

The B107 operates through a dual-driver system that combines the Rowsfire App with [MobiFlight](https://www.mobiflight.com/), the open-source connector that has become the standard interface between custom hardware and flight simulators. This combination is significant. The Rowsfire App provides out-of-the-box profiles and configuration management, while MobiFlight opens the door to deep customization -- custom button mappings, conditional logic, LED control based on simulator variables, and community-created profiles for aircraft that Rowsfire has not yet officially supported.

The entire system runs over a single USB connection with no external power supply required. Plug-and-play setup means that a new user can connect the panel, install the software, and be operational within minutes rather than hours.

### Simulator and Aircraft Support

Out of the box, the B107 is optimized for the PMDG 737 lineup in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Given that PMDG's 737 is the most popular study-level airliner in the MSFS ecosystem, this is the right priority. The panel supports MSFS 2020, MSFS 2024, X-Plane 11, and X-Plane 12 -- covering the two dominant platforms that account for the vast majority of the home cockpit community.

Rowsfire has confirmed that official profiles for the Zibo Mod 737, iFly 737 MAX, Level Up 737, and Laminar Research's default 737 will arrive in future updates. The MobiFlight foundation means that community profiles will likely appear even faster than official ones -- the MobiFlight community is large, active, and experienced in creating configurations for new hardware. For pilots who fly across multiple platforms and aircraft, as covered in our [hardware review guide](/blog/hardware-review-joystick-yoke/), this cross-platform flexibility is a genuine advantage over panels locked to a single simulator.

## Standard Edition vs. Pro

The B107 launched in a Standard Edition configuration, with a Pro variant announced for May 2026. The Standard Edition now includes an EGT gauge at no additional cost -- a feature originally planned as a Pro exclusive that Rowsfire moved into the base package in response to community feedback.

The Pro version will add lift switches (guarded, locking switches) to replace the Standard Edition's marked toggle switches in key positions. These lift switches replicate the protective guards found on the real 737 overhead for critical systems -- engine fire handles, fuel cutoff, and similar functions where accidental activation would be catastrophic. For simmers focused on procedural accuracy, the lift switches add a layer of tactile realism that standard toggles cannot provide. For everyone else, the Standard Edition covers the operational functionality without the premium.

## Pricing and Availability

The B107 Standard Edition is available at $699.99 USD through the [Rowsfire Store](https://rowsfire.com/products/rowsfire-b107-b737-overhead-panel) and authorized resellers. Rowsfire ran a tiered pre-sale campaign in January 2026: early bird buyers secured the panel at $559.99 with a free storage bag, while the advanced pre-sale period offered it at $599.99. Shipping of pre-sale orders began on February 25, 2026, fulfilled in order of purchase confirmation.

In the context of the 737 home cockpit market, the B107's pricing is competitive. Professional-grade overhead panels from established cockpit builders routinely exceed $1,500, and some full-scale replicas approach $3,000 or more. The B107 delivers metal construction, LED backlighting, and MobiFlight integration at roughly half the price of the nearest comparable product -- a value proposition that mirrors the approach Rowsfire successfully executed with its A107 Airbus overhead.

## What It Means for the Community

The B107 marks Rowsfire's expansion from a single-platform manufacturer into a multi-type cockpit hardware company. The A-Series covered Airbus; the B-Series now covers Boeing; the D-Series handles DCS and Garmin panels. This breadth matters because home cockpit builders rarely fly a single aircraft type exclusively. A pilot who flies the PMDG 737 on weekday evenings and the Fenix A320 on weekends can now source both overhead panels from the same manufacturer, with the same build quality philosophy, the same mounting system, and the same software architecture.

For the broader simulation community, the B107 represents a continued democratization of cockpit hardware. Five years ago, a metal-construction, backlit overhead panel with plug-and-play simulator integration was either unavailable or priced beyond the reach of most hobbyists. The combination of improved manufacturing capabilities, open-source software like MobiFlight, and competition among hardware makers has pushed prices down and quality up. Paired with a capable [HOTAS system](/blog/best-hotas-flight-controllers-2026/) and a study-level aircraft add-on, the B107 brings the home cockpit experience closer to what professional training devices offer -- not identical, but closer than it has ever been.

The ceiling of the 737 is no longer out of reach.
