The flight simulation community has never had it better. Two heavyweights — **Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024** and **X-Plane 12** — are competing for the attention of virtual pilots worldwide, and each platform brings genuinely compelling strengths to the table. If you are trying to decide where to invest your time and money, this comprehensive comparison will give you the clarity you need.

## Graphics and Visuals

**MSFS 2024** continues to set the benchmark for visual fidelity in civilian flight simulation. Leveraging Bing satellite imagery, photogrammetry for major cities, and a physically-based rendering pipeline, the simulator delivers a world that is breathtaking from cruise altitude all the way down to ground level. Volumetric clouds, dynamic lighting, and seasonal variations create an atmosphere that frequently looks photorealistic.

**X-Plane 12** made a significant leap from its predecessor with a new rendering engine featuring volumetric clouds, real-time ray marching for weather effects, and improved terrain textures. While it does not match MSFS in raw photorealism — particularly in satellite-derived ground textures — X-Plane 12's atmospheric rendering is excellent, and many pilots argue its weather visuals are more physically accurate, especially in how precipitation and cloud layers interact.

### The Verdict on Visuals

MSFS 2024 wins on pure eye candy. X-Plane 12 holds its own with atmospheric authenticity. If you are a VFR pilot who values recognizable landmarks and stunning vistas, MSFS has the edge. If you care more about weather systems behaving realistically, X-Plane deserves serious consideration.

## Flight Model Accuracy

This is where the philosophical divide between the two platforms becomes most apparent. **X-Plane 12** uses a **blade element theory** (BET) flight model that calculates aerodynamic forces across the entire airframe in real time. Every control surface, every section of wing, every propeller blade is modeled individually. The result is a flight model that responds to unusual attitudes, stalls, spins, and crosswind conditions with remarkable fidelity.

**MSFS 2024** employs a hybrid approach, using lookup tables combined with aerodynamic simulation. Microsoft significantly improved the flight model with the 2024 release — particularly for general aviation aircraft — but the system still relies heavily on authored performance data rather than pure physics simulation. Third-party developers like PMDG and Fenix can override much of this with custom flight dynamics, and their aircraft often feel superb.

For **instrument training** and exploring the edges of the flight envelope, X-Plane remains the preferred platform among real-world pilots and CFIs. For everyday flying along airways and approaches, both simulators feel excellent.

## Aircraft Selection: Default and Addon

**MSFS 2024** ships with an enormous default fleet spanning general aviation, turboprops, business jets, and airliners, including a fully featured Boeing 737-800 and Airbus A320neo. The quality of default aircraft improved substantially with the 2024 release, with many featuring near study-level systems depth.

The **MSFS marketplace** and third-party ecosystem is massive. PMDG's 737 and 777, Fenix's A320, and Leonardo's Maddog are just a few of the study-level addons available. The sheer volume of payware and freeware aircraft is staggering.

**X-Plane 12** ships with a smaller but carefully modeled default fleet. The default Cessna 172 is widely regarded as one of the most accurate representations available in any simulator. The addon market is smaller but includes stellar offerings from Toliss (A321), FlightFactor (757/767), and Rotate (MD-80).

### Winner

MSFS 2024 wins on sheer volume and variety. X-Plane 12 wins if you prioritize depth of default aircraft modeling.

## Scenery and Airports

**MSFS 2024** covers the entire planet with satellite-derived terrain and has photogrammetry coverage for hundreds of cities. Many airports feature highly detailed, hand-crafted terminal buildings and ground layouts. The Bing data integration means even small rural airstrips are recognizable.

**X-Plane 12** relies on algorithmic terrain generation combined with community-contributed airport data from the **Gateway**. While the base scenery is functional, it lacks the visual richness of MSFS. However, the X-Plane community has produced thousands of free, high-quality airport sceneries, and payware developers like Orbx and Verticalsim serve both platforms.

## VR Support

Both simulators support VR, but the experience differs considerably. **MSFS 2024** offers OpenXR support with impressive visual quality in the headset, though it demands extreme hardware to maintain smooth frame rates. Reprojection is almost mandatory for most setups.

**X-Plane 12** has native VR support that many users find more performant on equivalent hardware. The interaction model — using VR controllers to manipulate cockpit switches — is well implemented, and the lower GPU overhead means smoother experiences on mid-range systems.

For dedicated VR flyers, X-Plane 12 currently offers the more comfortable overall experience unless you have a top-tier PC.

## Performance Requirements

**MSFS 2024** is famously demanding. Our [flight simulator setup guide](/blog/flight-simulator-setup-guide) details exactly which graphics settings to prioritize for each platform. To run it at high settings with smooth performance, you will want a modern GPU (RTX 4070 or better), 32 GB of RAM, and fast storage. The simulator also requires a constant internet connection for streaming scenery data, which can be a dealbreaker for pilots with limited bandwidth.

**X-Plane 12** runs well on more modest hardware and does not depend on streaming data. An RTX 3060 with 16 GB of RAM will deliver a solid experience at medium-high settings. All scenery data is stored locally, making it fully functional offline.

## Multiplayer

**MSFS 2024** features built-in multiplayer with shared skies, live traffic integration, and group flight capabilities. The **career mode** added in 2024 includes cooperative mission elements. It is the more social platform out of the box.

**X-Plane 12** relies on third-party networks like **VATSIM** and **IVAO** for multiplayer, which both platforms support equally well. There is no built-in casual multiplayer comparable to MSFS.

## Pricing and Ecosystem

**MSFS 2024** uses a tiered pricing model with Standard, Deluxe, and Premium Deluxe editions. The in-sim marketplace takes a commission on third-party sales. An Xbox Game Pass subscription provides access to the Standard edition, making it remarkably affordable to try.

**X-Plane 12** is a one-time purchase with no ongoing subscription. The addon ecosystem operates through independent storefronts like the X-Plane.org store, with developers retaining more of each sale.

## Modding Community

Both platforms have passionate modding communities. MSFS benefits from the sheer size of its user base, which translates into a massive volume of freeware scenery, liveries, and utilities on sites like **flightsim.to**. Check out our list of the [top free addons](/blog/top-10-free-addons-flight-sim) to see the best of what is available across both platforms. X-Plane's community is smaller but deeply technical, with extensive plugin support through the **XPUIPC** and **FlyWithLua** frameworks, and a tradition of open development that Laminar Research actively encourages.

## Verdict: Which Simulator Is Right for You?

There is no single correct answer — it depends entirely on what kind of virtual pilot you are.

**Choose MSFS 2024 if** you value stunning visuals, want the largest aircraft and scenery library, prefer built-in multiplayer, or want to explore the world in VFR with photorealistic scenery. It is also the best entry point for newcomers thanks to Game Pass pricing -- our [beginner's guide to flight simulation](/blog/beginner-guide-flight-simulation) can help you get started.

**Choose X-Plane 12 if** you prioritize flight model accuracy, want a simulator that real-world pilots and instructors trust for procedures training, prefer VR flying on mid-range hardware, or value offline operation without streaming dependencies.

**Consider both** if budget allows. Many serious simmers maintain installations of both platforms, using MSFS for visual flying and X-Plane for systems study and instrument practice. The two simulators are more complementary than competing, and the flight simulation community is richer for having both pushing each other forward.
