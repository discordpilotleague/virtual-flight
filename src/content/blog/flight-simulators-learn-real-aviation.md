There is a persistent debate in aviation circles about whether flight simulators have any genuine value for learning to fly real aircraft. On one side, you have purists who insist that nothing substitutes for actual stick time. On the other, you have a growing body of evidence — and FAA regulation — that says simulators are not just useful, they are an officially recognized component of pilot training. The truth, as with most things in aviation, requires nuance.

## FAA-Approved Flight Training Devices: What Counts and What Does Not

The FAA classifies simulation devices into several categories, and understanding these distinctions matters if you want your sim time to actually count toward a certificate or rating.

**Aviation Training Devices (ATDs)** come in two flavors: Basic ATDs (BATDs) and Advanced ATDs (AATDs). A BATD must replicate the general flight characteristics of a fixed-wing aircraft or helicopter with sufficient fidelity to train procedural skills. An AATD goes further, requiring more realistic flight dynamics, a full complement of instruments, and a visual system. Under 14 CFR 61.51, pilots can log up to 10 hours of instrument training time in a BATD and up to 20 hours in an AATD toward an instrument rating.

Above ATDs sit **Flight Training Devices (FTDs)** at Levels 1 through 7, and **Full Flight Simulators (FFSs)** at Levels A through D. A Level D FFS is so realistic that airline pilots complete their entire type rating in one without ever touching the actual aircraft during training. These devices cost millions of dollars and are housed in dedicated training centers.

Where does your home simulator fit? Technically, it does not qualify as any FAA-approved device unless it has been specifically evaluated and approved. However — and this is the critical point — **the skills you develop in a home simulator transfer directly to real flying**, even if the hours do not appear in your logbook.

## How Simulators Complement Real Flight Training

The most effective way to think about simulator training is as a **cognitive rehearsal environment**. When you practice an ILS approach in MSFS 2024 or X-Plane 12 with a high-fidelity Cessna 172 addon, you are not learning how the aircraft feels in turbulence or how the control forces change near stall speed. Our [beginner's guide to flight simulation](/blog/beginner-guide-flight-simulation) helps you choose the right platform and addons for training-focused flying. What you are learning is the procedure, the sequence, the scan pattern, and the decision-making framework.

This distinction is profoundly important. Real flight training is expensive — at current rates, expect $180 to $250 per hour for aircraft rental plus instructor fees. Every minute you spend in the aircraft fumbling with radio frequencies or trying to remember the steps of an instrument approach is money burned. If you arrive at the airport already knowing the procedure cold because you rehearsed it twenty times at home, your actual flight time becomes dramatically more productive.

Flight instructors consistently report that students who supplement their training with simulator practice at home progress faster. Keeping a structured log of your practice sessions accelerates improvement -- our guide to [maintaining a virtual pilot career and logbook](/blog/virtual-pilot-career-logbook) explains how. Not marginally faster — significantly. A student who practices VOR tracking, GPS approaches, and holding patterns at home can often reduce their total flight hours to checkride by 10 to 20 percent.

## Instrument Procedures: Where Simulators Truly Excel

If there is one domain where home simulators provide outsized training value, it is instrument flight. The reason is simple: instrument flying is fundamentally a **procedural and cognitive task**. You are interpreting instruments, following published procedures, communicating with ATC, and making decisions — all activities that translate directly from simulator to cockpit.

### Approach Procedures

Practice flying ILS, VOR, RNAV (GPS), and localizer approaches repeatedly. Load up real-world approach plates from sources like the FAA's digital Terminal Procedures Publication or services like ForeFlight, and fly the full procedure from initial approach fix to missed approach point. In your simulator, you can fly the ILS 28R at San Francisco fifty times in an evening. In a real aircraft, that would cost you roughly $10,000 and require weeks of scheduling.

### Holding Patterns

Holding entries — direct, teeter, and parallel — confuse almost every instrument student. The mental model of picturing yourself on the holding fix, determining which sector you are entering from, and then executing the correct entry is something that benefits enormously from repetition. Simulators let you practice this endlessly without burning avgas.

### Departure and Arrival Procedures

SIDs (Standard Instrument Departures) and STARs (Standard Terminal Arrival Routes) are complex, multi-step procedures that often involve altitude restrictions, speed constraints, and specific routing. Practicing these in a simulator before flying them in real IFR conditions builds the kind of procedural fluency that keeps you ahead of the aircraft.

## Navigation and Radio Communication

Modern simulators with [online flying networks](/blog/best-online-flight-networks) like VATSIM or PilotEdge provide an environment where you practice real ATC communication with human controllers using proper phraseology. This is invaluable. The number one source of anxiety for student pilots is the radio, and the number one way to overcome that anxiety is practice.

In a simulator connected to VATSIM, you will request clearances, read back instructions, make position reports, and handle the full spectrum of ATC interactions. You will make mistakes in a consequence-free environment, and by the time you key the mic in a real aircraft, the words will flow naturally.

Navigation skills transfer exceptionally well from simulator to cockpit. Programming a Garmin G1000 or GNS 530 in your sim teaches you the exact button sequences and menu structures you will encounter in the real aircraft. The avionics do not care whether the GPS satellites are real or simulated — the interface is identical.

## Pre-Solo Preparation

For student pilots working toward their first solo, simulators offer specific benefits.

**Airport familiarization** is the most immediate one. Load your home airport in the simulator and practice the traffic pattern until you can fly it in your sleep. Learn the landmarks, the turn points, the runway numbers, and the taxiway layout. When your instructor signs you off for solo, the last thing you want is to be uncertain about which taxiway leads back to the ramp.

**Emergency procedures** are another area where simulator practice pays dividends. Practice engine failures on takeoff, engine failures in the pattern, and forced landings to nearby fields. In the simulator, you can practice the scenario that every pilot dreads but rarely experiences: the engine goes silent at 500 feet AGL on the departure leg. Developing the muscle memory to pitch for best glide, pick a landing spot, and run the checklist is something you can drill repeatedly in the sim.

**Checklist discipline** also develops naturally through simulator flying. If you use proper checklists for every phase of flight in the sim — preflight, before takeoff, cruise, descent, before landing, after landing, shutdown — those habits will carry over directly to the real aircraft.

## IFR Training: The Simulator Advantage

For pilots pursuing an instrument rating, the simulator becomes an even more powerful tool. The instrument rating requires a minimum of 40 hours of actual or simulated instrument time under 14 CFR 61.65, and the training syllabus is heavily weighted toward procedural knowledge.

Consider the typical instrument training progression: you start with basic attitude instrument flying, then move to intercepting and tracking courses, then holds, then approaches, then full IFR cross-country flights with multiple approaches. Every one of these skills has a significant procedural component that can be practiced at home.

The real cockpit adds elements that the simulator cannot replicate — the physiological effects of actual IMC, the subtle pressure changes during descent, the vibration and noise environment — but the procedural framework is identical. A student who arrives for their instrument lesson having already nailed the procedure is a student who can focus on those real-world sensory elements rather than struggling to remember what comes next.

## What You Can Learn in a Simulator

Let us be specific about the skills that transfer well:

- **Instrument scan patterns** — developing the radial scan that keeps you oriented on all six primary instruments
- **Procedure execution** — approach plates, departure procedures, arrival procedures, holding patterns
- **Avionics operation** — GPS programming, radio tuning, autopilot modes, FMS operation
- **ATC communication** — phraseology, readback/hearback, clearance copying
- **Navigation theory** — VOR radial interception, DME arcs, GPS waypoint sequencing
- **Checklist discipline** — systematic use of checklists for all flight phases
- **Situational awareness** — maintaining the mental picture of where you are relative to terrain, traffic, and weather
- **Decision-making frameworks** — go/no-go decisions, diversion planning, fuel management calculations
- **CRM basics** — if practicing with another person, crew resource management communication patterns

## What You Cannot Learn in a Simulator

Intellectual honesty demands acknowledging the limitations:

- **Control feel** — no consumer joystick or yoke replicates the back-pressure required to flare a Cessna 172 or the control forces in a crosswind. The proprioceptive feedback of real flight is irreplaceable.
- **G-forces and vestibular sensation** — your inner ear does not experience bank angles, turbulence, or the subtle seat-of-the-pants cues that experienced pilots rely on. This is precisely why spatial disorientation training requires actual flight or a very expensive motion platform.
- **Weather judgment** — you can study weather theory and interpret METARs in a sim, but the judgment to look at a building cumulus and decide whether to deviate comes only from real experience.
- **Real stress management** — simulator failures carry no consequences. Real emergencies produce adrenaline, tunnel vision, and time distortion that fundamentally alter your cognitive processing. The sim teaches the procedure; real experience teaches you to execute it under genuine pressure.
- **Physical aircraft handling** — ground effect, crosswind correction on short final, the feel of a stall break, rudder coordination during slow flight — these are kinesthetic skills that require the real aircraft.
- **Actual aerodynamic feedback** — the buffet before a stall, the yaw from an engine failure in a multi-engine aircraft, the sensation of wind shear on approach.

## Recommended Aircraft Models for Training

If your goal is real-world training transfer, fly the aircraft you are actually training in or plan to train in.

### Cessna 172 Skyhawk

The most-trained-in aircraft in history, and fortunately, one of the best-modeled aircraft in modern simulators. The default Cessna 172 in MSFS 2024 is competent, but for serious training, consider third-party models with accurate G1000 NXi avionics, realistic engine modeling, and proper weight and balance behavior. In X-Plane 12, the default 172 is already quite capable, and the Airfoillabs Cessna 172 is widely regarded as one of the most accurate general aviation models ever created for a consumer simulator.

### Diamond DA40 Diamond Star

Increasingly popular in flight schools due to its Garmin G1000 glass cockpit and excellent safety record, the DA40 is well-represented in both major simulators. Its T-tail configuration and FADEC-controlled engine require specific handling knowledge that transfers directly from sim to aircraft. Several third-party developers offer study-level DA40 models with fully functional G1000 avionics stacks.

For instrument training specifically, ensure whatever aircraft model you choose has a fully functional and accurate avionics suite. A pretty exterior model with a non-functional GPS is useless for procedural training.

## Real Pilot Experiences

The testimonial evidence from real-world pilots is compelling. Consider these perspectives:

**Marcus, Private Pilot and Instrument Student**: "I practiced the ILS 6R at Portland International in X-Plane probably a hundred times before I flew it for real. When my instructor had me fly it under the hood for the first time, I nailed it. He asked me how many times I had done it before. When I told him it was my first time in a real aircraft, he just shook his head and said the sim time was obvious."

**Sarah, Commercial Pilot**: "I got my private certificate in 48 hours of flight time, which is well below the national average. I attribute at least 10 of those saved hours to the fact that I practiced literally everything in my sim at home. Traffic patterns, steep turns, slow flight — I knew what to expect before every lesson."

**David, CFI with 3,000 hours**: "I actively recommend that my students practice at home in their simulators. The students who do it are noticeably more prepared. They know the flows, they know the procedures, and they spend less time in the aircraft figuring out basics. I would estimate it saves the average student $2,000 to $4,000 in training costs."

## Cost Savings Analysis

Let us put real numbers to this. The national average for a Private Pilot Certificate is approximately 60 to 75 flight hours, at an average cost of $200 to $250 per hour (aircraft rental plus instructor). That puts the total at $12,000 to $18,750 for flight training alone.

If simulator practice at home reduces your required flight hours by even 10 percent — a conservative estimate based on instructor reports — you save $1,200 to $1,875. For an instrument rating, where the savings from procedural practice are even greater, a 15 to 20 percent reduction in flight hours can save $2,000 to $4,000.

The cost of a capable home simulator setup — a decent yoke or joystick, rudder pedals, a mid-range PC, and quality software with training-grade aircraft addons — runs between $1,500 and $3,000. This means the simulator effectively **pays for itself during your first rating**, and continues to provide free practice for every subsequent rating, currency maintenance, and proficiency improvement.

For instrument-rated pilots maintaining IFR currency, the savings compound further. The requirement to log six approaches, a hold, and intercepting and tracking courses every six months can be partially maintained through simulator practice (with an instructor or examiner present for logging purposes with an approved device), and the procedural sharpness you maintain between flights in the real aircraft reduces the risk of skill degradation.

## Making It Work: Practical Recommendations

To maximize the training value of your simulator time, follow these principles:

1. **Fly with purpose.** Do not just launch and cruise around. Create a training plan that mirrors your real-world syllabus. If your next lesson covers steep turns and slow flight, practice those maneuvers in the sim.

2. **Use real-world procedures.** File IFR flight plans using real airways and approaches. Use actual weather or at least set conditions that match what you expect to encounter. Fly complete flights from engine start to shutdown.

3. **Practice communication.** Connect to VATSIM or PilotEdge and talk to controllers. If flying offline, verbalize your radio calls out loud. The goal is fluency, and that requires practice.

4. **Review your performance.** Many simulator platforms offer replay functionality. Watch your approaches from an external view. Analyze your altitude deviations during holds. Be your own harshest critic.

5. **Study the theory alongside the practice.** Combine simulator sessions with ground school study. After reading about VOR navigation, go fly a VOR approach. After studying weather theory, practice flying in simulated IMC. The combination of theoretical knowledge and practical application accelerates learning dramatically.

The flight simulator will never replace the aircraft. But used intelligently, it is one of the most powerful supplementary training tools available to pilots at any stage of their career. The FAA recognizes it, flight instructors recommend it, and the mathematics of training cost reduction make the investment compelling. If you are serious about learning to fly — or about maintaining and improving the skills you already have — the simulator deserves a structured role in your training regimen.
