Scenery is the soul of flight simulation. You can have the most accurately modeled aircraft in the world, but if the ground below looks like a watercolor painting from 2004, the immersion breaks the moment you glance out the window. The good news for sim pilots in 2026 is that scenery add-ons have reached a level of fidelity that was genuinely unimaginable five years ago. Between photogrammetry advances, procedural generation improvements, and the sheer volume of hand-crafted content from dedicated developers, the virtual world below your wings can now look startlingly close to reality.

This guide covers the best scenery add-ons available right now across MSFS 2024 and X-Plane 12, organized by category so you can prioritize what matters most to your flying style.

## Best Airport Scenery Developers

Airport scenery is where most sim pilots invest first, and for good reason — it is the environment you see up close during the most demanding phases of flight. A well-made airport transforms departure and arrival from a chore into an event.

### FlyTampa

**FlyTampa** has been producing airport scenery since the FS2004 era, and their institutional knowledge shows in every release. Their airports are characterized by meticulous terminal interiors, accurate jetway placement, and ground textures that hold up even when you zoom in from the cockpit during pushback. In 2026, their standout releases include **EHAM Amsterdam Schiphol** and an updated **KJFK John F. Kennedy** for MSFS 2024. FlyTampa airports typically run $20–$28 and represent some of the best value in the payware market.

What sets FlyTampa apart is attention to operational detail. You will find correctly placed hold-short lines, accurate taxiway signage that matches real-world charts, and seasonal variations that adjust vegetation and lighting. Their EHAM includes the distinctive Schiphol Plaza interior and the curved terminal rooflines that make the airport instantly recognizable from any angle.

### iniBuilds

**iniBuilds** has expanded aggressively from their aircraft development roots into scenery, and the results have been impressive. Their airport portfolio now covers major hubs across multiple continents, with particularly strong offerings at **EGLL London Heathrow**, **KATL Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson**, and **VIDP Delhi Indira Gandhi**. iniBuilds airports tend to push the envelope on visual complexity — expect dense ground clutter, animated ground service equipment, and PBR materials throughout.

The iniBuilds marketplace has also become a significant distribution platform for third-party scenery, which means buying one of their airports often integrates cleanly with other content you own. Prices range from free (several of their airports are released at no charge) to $25 for major international hubs.

### Orbx

**Orbx** remains the most prolific scenery developer in the ecosystem. Their catalog is enormous, spanning individual airports, region packs, and global texture replacements. For MSFS 2024, their **TrueEarth** regional packages cover entire countries with enhanced autogen buildings, custom vegetation, and improved road networks. The **Australia v2** and **Great Britain** TrueEarth packs are particularly impressive, transforming VFR flying over those regions into something approaching photorealistic.

Orbx also produces high-quality individual airports. **LOWI Innsbruck** is a perennial favorite for its challenging approach surrounded by towering Alps, and their **NZQN Queenstown** captures New Zealand's dramatic South Island landscape beautifully. Orbx products range from $8 for small GA strips to $40 for major TrueEarth regions.

## Mesh and Terrain Add-ons

Default terrain mesh in both major simulators has improved dramatically, but it still has blind spots — particularly in mountainous regions where elevation data resolution matters most.

### Orbx Global Mesh

The **Orbx Global Mesh** product replaces the default terrain elevation data with higher-resolution SRTM and ALOS data worldwide. The difference is most noticeable in areas with sharp elevation changes: alpine valleys, coastal cliffs, fjords, and canyon systems. If you fly VFR through the Alps, the Norwegian fjords, or the American Southwest, this is close to essential. The visual improvement in mountain ridgelines alone justifies the $30 price.

### FreeMeshX and HD Mesh v5

For **X-Plane 12** pilots, **HD Mesh v5** by alpilotx remains the gold standard free terrain mesh. It covers the entire globe at approximately 19-meter resolution using the best available public elevation data. The download is enormous — expect to dedicate 200–300 GB of disk space for global coverage — but the quality improvement over default X-Plane terrain is transformative. River valleys, mountain passes, and coastal features all gain significant definition.

**FreeMeshX** serves a similar role for MSFS users who want improved terrain without committing to Orbx's paid offering. Coverage is less uniform, but the community maintains patches for popular flying areas.

## Ortho Scenery: Satellite Imagery on the Ground

Orthophotographic scenery replaces the simulator's procedurally generated ground textures with real satellite or aerial photography. The result is ground that looks exactly like the real world from altitude, including actual field patterns, real road layouts, and genuine building footprints.

### Ortho4XP

**Ortho4XP** remains the primary tool for X-Plane ortho scenery generation. It downloads satellite imagery tiles from various sources and compiles them into X-Plane-compatible scenery packages. The quality depends entirely on the source imagery — some areas of Europe have sub-meter resolution aerial photography available for free, while remote regions may only have 10-meter Sentinel data. Generating ortho is time-consuming and storage-intensive, but the results at low altitude are unmatched by any procedural system.

In 2026, the community has developed streamlined workflows and pre-built ortho packages for popular flying regions, reducing the barrier to entry significantly. Expect to budget 50–100 GB per region for high-quality ortho coverage.

### Google Earth and Bing Maps Integration

**MSFS 2024** benefits from its deep integration with Bing Maps satellite imagery, which provides ortho-quality ground textures globally without any add-on required. However, coverage quality varies by region — major metropolitan areas look stunning, while rural areas in developing countries can appear blurry. Several community tools now allow supplementing Bing data with higher-resolution imagery for specific areas.

The relationship between sim platforms and mapping providers continues to evolve. X-Plane's partnership with various data providers has improved its out-of-box ground textures considerably in version 12, though MSFS still holds the edge in raw satellite imagery coverage.

## City Scenery and Landmarks

Urban environments push scenery technology to its limits. Rendering a convincing cityscape requires millions of polygons for buildings, accurate road networks, realistic vegetation, and correct lighting.

### Photogrammetry Cities

MSFS 2024 includes photogrammetry coverage for hundreds of cities worldwide, rendering actual 3D-scanned building geometry rather than generic autogen blocks. The effect is dramatic — flying over photogrammetry London, New York, or Tokyo feels genuinely like the real thing. Third-party developers like **Predigital** and **Bijan Habashi** have filled gaps in the default coverage with additional city packs.

### Hand-Crafted Landmarks

For iconic structures that photogrammetry doesn't capture well — bridges, monuments, stadiums, transmission towers — dedicated landmark packs fill the gap. **Orbx Landmarks** series covers major cities with accurately modeled points of interest. The **Sydney** pack includes a stunning Opera House and Harbour Bridge, while the **Paris** pack features a detailed Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame, and the entire Champs-Elysees corridor.

In X-Plane 12, the **SAM (Scenery Animation Manager)** plugin enables animated elements in scenery — opening hangar doors, moving jetways, and seasonal decorations — that bring airports and landmarks to life in ways that static scenery cannot.

## Library Objects and Ground Clutter

Library objects are shared 3D assets that scenery developers place throughout their products: hangars, fuel trucks, windsocks, terminal furniture, fences, taxiway signs, and thousands of other items. The quality of these libraries directly affects how alive and detailed any scenery package looks.

### OpenSceneryX

For X-Plane, **OpenSceneryX** is the foundational shared library that most freeware scenery depends on. It contains thousands of categorized objects — aircraft, buildings, vehicles, vegetation, and effects — that scenery designers can reference without bundling the assets themselves. Keeping OpenSceneryX updated ensures compatibility with the widest range of community scenery.

### MSFS Marketplace Libraries

In the MSFS ecosystem, the **Marketplace** and **Flightsim.to** community repository serve a similar function. The **Asobo Generic Scenery Library** updates included with MSFS 2024 world updates have dramatically improved the default ground clutter worldwide, adding region-appropriate buildings, vehicles, and vegetation that give even unmodified areas a convincing lived-in quality.

## Seasonal Textures and Weather Integration

Static scenery is yesterday's standard. In 2026, the best scenery add-ons react to seasons and weather conditions.

### bext and Environment Mods

**bext (Better Environment and Xvision Textures)** for X-Plane 12 provides comprehensive seasonal ground texture replacements. Snow coverage in winter follows elevation and latitude realistically, autumn foliage varies by tree species and region, and summer textures include regional variations between temperate and tropical zones. The integration with X-Plane's weather engine means puddle and wet ground effects appear correctly after rain.

### MSFS Seasons and Live Weather

MSFS 2024's built-in seasonal system is the most advanced in any consumer simulator. Snow coverage follows real-world weather data, trees lose leaves in autumn based on species and latitude, and ground textures transition smoothly between seasons. Third-party enhancers like **Rex AccuSeason** can further refine these transitions and add additional detail to seasonal effects.

## Performance Impact of Scenery Add-ons

Scenery add-ons consume three primary resources: **VRAM** (for textures), **RAM** (for mesh and object data), and **CPU** (for draw calls and object placement).

### VRAM Budget

Modern airport scenery can use 2--4 GB of VRAM on its own. If you are flying in [VR](/blog/vr-flight-simulation-complete-guide), the demands are even higher since every frame is rendered twice. If you are running multiple complex scenery packages simultaneously — a detailed departure airport, ortho ground textures, and a city scenery pack — you can easily push past 8 GB of VRAM usage. In 2026, a **12 GB GPU** (RTX 4070 Ti or better) is the realistic minimum for running high-quality scenery without constant texture streaming stutters. 16 GB cards like the RTX 4080 or RX 7900 XT provide genuine breathing room.

### RAM and Storage

Ortho scenery is the biggest RAM and storage consumer. A single ortho tile at zoom level 17 can be 500 MB–1 GB. Flying across an ortho-covered region loads and unloads these tiles continuously, so both RAM capacity (32 GB minimum recommended) and storage speed (NVMe SSD essentially required) directly affect smoothness. Putting ortho scenery on a mechanical hard drive will result in visible tile loading and texture pop-in.

### Optimization Tips

- **Prioritize LOD settings** -- both MSFS and X-Plane allow you to control object and terrain Level of Detail distances. Our [flight simulator setup guide](/blog/flight-simulator-setup-guide) covers these settings in depth for each platform. Reducing these slightly can recover 10–20 fps without dramatically affecting visual quality at cruise altitude.
- **Use scenery exclusion zones** — if you install a detailed payware airport, make sure it properly excludes the default scenery underneath. Double-rendered scenery wastes GPU cycles.
- **Disable scenery you are not using** — both simulators load all active scenery into memory. If you have 200 GB of ortho for a region you are not currently flying in, disable it in your scenery library.
- **Monitor VRAM usage** — tools like GPU-Z or MSFS's built-in developer mode overlay show real-time VRAM consumption, letting you identify which add-ons are most expensive.

## Freeware vs. Payware Scenery

The freeware scenery community in 2026 is extraordinarily productive. Platforms like **Flightsim.to**, **X-Plane.org**, and **AVSIM** host thousands of free airports, terrain enhancements, and landmark packs.

### When Freeware Is Enough

For airports you visit occasionally, freeware scenery is often perfectly adequate. Our guide to the [best free addons for flight simulation](/blog/top-10-free-addons-flight-sim) covers many excellent freeware scenery options alongside aircraft and utility mods. Many community developers produce work that rivals commercial quality — particularly for smaller regional airports that payware developers skip. The **Flightsim.to** community has produced free versions of hundreds of airports worldwide that include custom buildings, accurate layouts, and seasonal variations.

### When Payware Is Worth It

Payware earns its price at airports you use as home bases or frequent destinations. The difference shows in terminal interiors visible during pushback, animated jetways with accurate docking behavior, optimized performance through careful LOD management, and ongoing updates as the real airport changes. If you fly a regular VATSIM route between two major hubs, investing $25 each in high-quality scenery for both airports will transform the experience.

### The Middle Ground

Several developers have adopted a freemium model: a basic version of the airport is free, with a paid upgrade adding interior detail, animated features, and enhanced ground textures. This is an excellent approach that lets you evaluate whether a scenery package meets your standards before committing money.

## Regional Coverage: Where to Start

### Europe

Europe enjoys the best overall scenery coverage in both simulators. High-resolution aerial imagery is widely available through government data portals, photogrammetry coverage in MSFS is extensive, and the developer community has produced detailed scenery for airports ranging from London Heathrow to tiny Alpine grass strips. **Orbx TrueEarth Great Britain** and **iniBuilds' European airport collection** are strong starting points.

### North America

North American coverage is similarly strong, with excellent photogrammetry in MSFS for most major and mid-tier cities. The freeware community on Flightsim.to has produced outstanding coverage of smaller regional airports, and payware developers like **FlyTampa**, **iniBuilds**, and **Orbx** maintain extensive North American portfolios. **Terraflora** by Orbx replaces North American vegetation with more accurate, higher-detail models.

### Asia-Pacific

Asia-Pacific coverage has improved dramatically but remains less comprehensive than Western markets. **iniBuilds VIDP Delhi** and **SamScene3D** Hong Kong and Singapore products are standouts. Japanese airports are well-served by a dedicated domestic developer community, and Australia benefits from Orbx's long-standing focus on their home region. Coverage of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent is growing rapidly.

## Installation and Management Tips

### Scenery Order Matters

In X-Plane, scenery library order determines which scenery takes priority when multiple packages cover the same area. Higher entries in the scenery_packs.ini file take precedence. Placing your payware airports above global terrain packages ensures the airport scenery displays correctly. MSFS handles priority through its Content Manager, but load order conflicts can still occur with third-party injected scenery.

### Use an Add-on Manager

Tools like **Addon Linker** for MSFS and **X-Organizer** for X-Plane let you enable and disable scenery packages without moving files around, making it easy to maintain a lean active library for performance while keeping everything installed.

### Keep Backups

Before major simulator updates, back up your Community folder (MSFS) or Custom Scenery folder (X-Plane). Simulator updates occasionally break compatibility with older scenery packages, and having a backup means you can quickly restore your setup while waiting for developers to release patches.

### Verify File Integrity

After installing complex scenery packages, verify that all files are present and correctly placed. Missing texture files result in white or flickering surfaces, while misplaced files can cause the scenery to fail to load entirely. Most payware installers handle this automatically, but manual freeware installations require more care.

## Looking Ahead

The scenery landscape is evolving rapidly. AI-assisted 3D modeling is accelerating the production of detailed airport terminals. Cloud-streamed photogrammetry continues to improve in resolution and coverage. Procedural generation algorithms are producing increasingly convincing urban environments from map data alone. The gap between default scenery and add-on scenery is narrowing — but add-ons continue to push the boundary of what is possible, ensuring there will always be a meaningful upgrade available for pilots who want the most realistic virtual world beneath their wings.

Investing in scenery transforms flight simulation from a technical exercise into a genuinely immersive experience. Start with the airports you fly most often, add terrain and ortho for your favorite VFR regions, and build from there. The virtual world has never looked better.
